Anyone, from advanced users - to beginners looking for knowledge - can profit from every issue of MaxPC. the icing on the cake is the subscription that comes with a CD-ROM as it is packed with demos, utilities, and other useful apps (very helpful for those not blessed with broadband connections). Until I discovered the community of hardware enthusiast web sites, MaxPC, formerly ""boot"", was my only really informative source for computing news and articles. To this day, i consider my subscription to it worth more than 10 subscriptions to most other computing mags.

2,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005N7OJ,"Antiques Magazine is a publication made for antique lovers and history buffs and its pages are loaded with photos of artistic paintings, handmade goods, rare pictures, and other items of similar nature. It is a magazine for those who love antiques and also those who consider themselves historians since many articles deal with historical collections of art and antiques.

This magazine is overflowing with antique goods and information. The articles contained in this magazine are intended to be visually stimulating in some cases, educational in others. They offer history lessons on the art that was popular during a specific era, a glimpse into an art collection at a museum, and more. The articles are meant to stimulate the interests of those who already like this subject and they often provide a means to learn more, to discover places to see or purchase some of the featured works, and to develop an appreciation for the craftsmanship that went into making these items.

Antiques Magazine is a publication dedicated to creative art and history but one thing that isn't very creative is the titles of the articles. This might surprise some readers at first, but the editors at Antiques decided to get straight to the point in the naming of the featured articles rather than try to be creative. The features thus have titles like ""The Eating Utensil Collection"", ""Spanish Culture in Art"", etc. Each title points out exactly what the article covers, leaving nothing to the imagination.

The writing in Antiques is certainly good and well- edited. But I'm afraid that many readers will find the articles a little boring. They describe things well and they usually offer a good history lesson. But they lack spark and readability. I have tried to read some articles in this magazine and found my eyelids getting heavy and my thoughts drifting to other subjects. This is why I generally stick with the pictures when I glance at Antiques Magazine. I don't bother reading because most of the material doesn't keep my interest.

Overall, Antiques Magazine is an okay publication and unless you have a deep interest in antiques and their history, you will likely become bored quickly if you try to read the articles. But the pictures in Antiques are often very interesting. Even if you have little interest in reading a magazine like this one, the photos alone make it worth an occasional look.",Magazine,2007-03-24,3,positive,antiques magazine publication made antique lovers history buffs pages loaded photos artistic paintings handmade goods rare pictures items similar nature magazine love antiques also consider historians since many articles deal historical collections art antiques magazine overflowing antique goods information articles contained magazine intended visually stimulating cases educational others offer history lessons art popular specific era glimpse art collection museum articles meant stimulate interests already subject often provide means learn discover places see purchase featured works develop appreciation craftsmanship went making items antiques magazine publication dedicated creative art history but one thing isnt creative titles articles might surprise readers first but editors antiques decided get straight point naming featured articles rather try creative features thus titles eating utensil collection spanish culture art etc title points exactly article covers leaving nothing imagination writing antiques certainly good well edited but im afraid many readers find articles little boring describe things well usually offer good history lesson but lack spark readability tried read articles magazine found eyelids getting heavy thoughts drifting subjects generally stick pictures glance antiques magazine dont bother reading material doesnt keep interest overall antiques magazine okay publication unless deep interest antiques history likely become bored quickly try read articles but pictures antiques often interesting even little interest reading magazine one photos alone make worth occasional look,0.13986486486486488,positive,22.0,positive,positive

6,A3ERU005ES1IHT,B00005N7P0,"I've read Maximum PC (MPC) for many years. The articles in it are not too technical and are written with light humor. That makes it very easy to read while at the same time it is imparting in-depth technical know-how.

 If you are a newbie, in no time you possess expert knowledge of computers and, to an extent, of electronics.

If you are already advanced, then you get even more advanced. Period.

As an MPC reader you naturally become the PC nerd amongst your friends, family, and coworkers, that everybody keeps coming to for advise and requests for help.

For instance at the launch of new operating system, such as with windows 8, and win 7, you'll get mobbed by confused hordes of PC users with a lost sense of direction.

You become their sole bastion of hope standing solidly there in the middle, that they can hold on to for guidance.

There are also little tid bits of information that can unexpectedly result in huge payoffs. In a little corner in one issue for example, they showed how to insert a check mark in my Utorrent software, that encrypted its outgoing traffic, so that my ISP couldn't invade my privacy anymore, and so had to stop bothering and threatening me about my sharing of copyrighted materials with my friends. That was a relief!

I also like the fact that the magazine deals with both computer hardware, and software - though the emphasis is on hardware.

There are also letters to the computer doctor who diagnoses and then gives good advice on a range of computer illnesses and hiccups.

You also get the latest news taking place in the tech world and on copyright issues.

Overall It is a well rounded publication with a little for everyone, young and old, great and small.

Better than the Maximum PC app itself that doesn't really work.",Magazine,2014-06-01,5,positive,ive read maximum pc mpc many years articles not technical written light humor makes easy read time imparting indepth technical knowhow newbie no time possess expert knowledge computers extent electronics already advanced get even advanced period mpc reader naturally become pc nerd amongst friends family coworkers everybody keeps coming advise requests help instance launch new operating system windows win youll get mobbed confused hordes pc users lost sense direction become sole bastion hope standing solidly middle hold guidance also little tid bits information unexpectedly result huge payoffs little corner one issue example showed insert check mark utorrent software encrypted outgoing traffic isp couldnt invade privacy stop bothering threatening sharing copyrighted materials friends relief also fact magazine deals computer hardware software though emphasis hardware also letters computer doctor diagnoses gives good advice range computer illnesses hiccups also get latest news taking place tech world copyright issues overall well rounded publication little everyone young old great small kindle ipad version absolute best better maximum pc app doesnt really work,0.22611024033437824,positive,14.0,positive,positive

What I like about this magazine?

***Ask Handyman
Here are questions from readers that are answered on various projects.

***Workshop Tips
In this section readers offer suggestions to use in your workshop to make a project go smoother.

***Handy Hints
More reader suggestions to help around the house.  (It's like having that wise old handyman offer you tons of tips and ideas.)

***Great Goofs
Funny errors do-it-yourselfers offer on projects they attempted.

What I don't like about the magazine?

***New Products Section

These are the short, usually a paragraph or two, tips and suggestions that include a new product that makes a project easier.  A web address or toll-free number to order the product follows the article.  I often wonder if the product is really good or if the manufacturer just paid the magazine to talk it up.

44,A3PQQVU8NHR7PM,B00005N7P0,"I started off in the early days with a ""Boot"" subscription that eventually morphed itself into Maximum PC. The magazine's writing and tone always felt just about right and in the days before Internet, was the only way to actually get good information about hardware. Maximum PC, PC Gamer and Computer Shopper were required reading for me in my early years of computer building and upgrading.

Fast forward many years later and I finally let me subscription lapse and never renewed. Chalk it up to the immediacy of the Internet and all the new hardware sites that left me wondering why I would need to read information 2-3 months out of date.

However, on a recent business trip I picked up a newsstand copy for the flight and was struck at how much I enjoyed reading good content again. And to the writers credit, they have changed content slightly to highlight articles that do not suffer from a few months delay.

I work in a circulation department for another magazine and I get all the frustration magazine customers have at slow delivery, fulfillment of old issues and all those many many ads. My only defense is where else can you get an hour (or so) entertainment for 42 cents a month? Even double that price is still an insanely low price for such quality content.

Sure I have the Internet for the day 1 reviews of new hardware launches and 10 page articles on tweaks to get 1 FPS more out of Skyrim but truthfully my patience for that type of involvement with my computer has dropped considerably.

 The problem isn't with the magazine though. THe problem is if you sign up for auto-renew, Amazon will make it very difficult to stop it.  The most obvious solution, click the ""stop auto-renew"" button does absolutely nothing except take you to the top of the page. WOW. Thank God I was able to return to the top of the page.  But Wait, that's not your only option: you can also click the ""cancel subscription"" button.  It, too, takes you to the top of the page. Ah-ha, we have a pattern here.  At the top of the page is a sentence stating that you must call a certain phone number to cancel or change subscriptions. So those two buttons are... the modern day racing stripes for a web site with no function at all, mererly appearance? But this slick, digital interface Will help you utilize their 130 year old technology to stop your subscription.

are the industry standards like Esquire (quite possibly the best magazine out there) and GQ. There's the more risque like Maxim or even the low-brow Stuff, worth getting. Then there are those that fall somewhere in the middle, like FHM and Details. Even without seeing magazines like Esquire or Maxim, you can see that Details falls short. It's a glossy magazine that usually has pretty good covers, but that's where the excellence stops. The articles are generally substandard. They are usually poorly written or can't seem to get the facts straight. Their only saving grace is that they are so short (which is a problem when you run across the occasionally well-done, interesting article). And Details is not a magazine that seems to have its hand on the
pulse of the nation. More often than not, you skim through, looking for something interesting to read, and close it finding none. And in a men's interest/fashion magazine, nothing is more important than the photos. Unfortunately they are not that great. The photo spreads are way too short. But since the photographers have taken amatuerish or just poorly done
photographs, it actually works out. Basically what you have with

However, today it is more important that Intel just announced flaws in the Sandy Bridge chipset and has issued a recall.

162,A2MDVO0ET00EAE,B00005N7P0,"Hi! This is a good magazine. I will cut to the chase about why I subscribe to it and the reason why most everyone else out there does too - it's those program CD-ROMs that include a ton of things that you can use that are mostly all free. Yah, I can go out and find them myself instead of having the CD-ROM at your disposal, but often you do not know what you are looking for when you search online for a solution or program... ... or your search engine overlooks a program(s) out there that you want. There are tons of handy and very useful tools and utilities on them.  It saves me a lot of work searching. This is the plus.
Now, the magazine articles are okay. Lately, I have found that they are discussing issues not of importance to me. I am seeing more ads in them than the older issues that had better old core help providing assistance with common programs users have and solutions to common issues. Once in a while I find in an issue an article I like that serves some use, but it is now hit or miss. It used to be that EVERY issue had some practical assistance I could use. Again, the reason that I subscribe is those CD-ROMs, I will not lie here.
Now, the latest issue I am having with them is there subscription renewal service after you have had them for one year (or more) and they tell you that you need to renew when you haven't finished receiving all your paid subscription issues. They tell you that you HAVE received (in my case) all 12 issues when I have only received 10 to date. They state that they expect to receive you payment for renewal when you haven't finished your first year subscription service. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE HERE! I still have 2 issues before my current subscription is done.  I believe that I will pay them when my renewal is done. After I receive my last two (2) issues for this subscription period, them I will pay to renew for the next subscription period. The reason why I do not pay in advance is I will get short changed and it makes it very difficult to correct this issue at a later date.  I had an issue with this and I need it resolved, so I contacted their customer service department via e-mail.  They replied back to me promptly. They stated that my last two issues were in the mailing process and my current subscription period will expire in November 2010 which is correct. I agree when it will expire. We are on the same page here. However, ""when payment is received, service will continue through the October 2010 issue."" Now, this is B.S.

However, I am disappointed with the magazine itself, now that I have been receiving it for about six months. As some of the other reviewers have noted, a huge portion of the magazine is taken up with glossy advertising, most of which is for clothing that only investment bankers or movie stars are likely to purchase. I like clothes, but it would be nice to see clothing lines other than couture advertised. More disturbingly, the magazine seems to have a split personality in its approach to masculinity. Many articles are written from the viewpoint of the stereotypical uber-masculine American male, with lots of references to heterosexual relationships, and other ""guy stuff."" Yet other articles come off as attempting to be from a gay-friendly viewpoint. I prefer the latter, but I don't see the point in having gay-friendly material when the rest of the magazine is trying to be a go-to guide for red-blooded males.

There was also an article about flowers and their importance to protests and the ""Resist"" movement. The only other content was ads and product shilling. Why they felt the need to politicize fashion/beauty is beyond me, and I cant imagine anyone wants to get their social/political commentary sandwiched between lipstick and shampoo ads out of a magazine called ""Allure"".

277,AF5FTJL71VB7L,B00005N7OU,"First of all, I was a subscriber of Bass Player Magazine for about 6 years. That is about the time I started playing bass guitar in a rock cover band. Bass Player has changed over the years and I enjoy the newer articles on the rockers that I actually listen to in real life. I don't care so much for the jazz and upright bass scene, but the articles are interesting to read just the same. I find almost all the bass transcriptions way beyond my ability, but that probably only shows my lack of skill. I don't know how some reviewers state that the magazine is good for beginners, everything seems just beyond my reach, and I have been successfully playing bass in a cover band for years. I do think Bass Player is making more of an attempt at reaching players at my level, but they just don't seem to hit the mark, IMHO. I read the articles and get motivated by the stories. So the magazine is good in that respect.

If I want to learn how to play something I can use in the band, I turn to YouTube.com for a video lesson or ultimate-guitar.com for the bass tab. Both of those resources are free, and have the resource material I need to learn to play a song. Bass Player typically only has one bass transcription per issue. If I could actually play some of those transcriptions, maybe I would feel more positive about it. But Bass Player typically picks songs with complicated bass lines that are beyond my ability. If you can play complicated extended 16th note bass lines, there is probably some good material there.

296,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005N7PS,"Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles. The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.

Some things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the ""departments"". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being ""Know- Tell"" and the ""The Details""). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.

As far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.

I like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads ""Is Your Wife a Bad Mom""? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don't like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.

The writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn't bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one's perspective.

Besides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the ""Anthropology"" page at the end. This closing ""article"" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don't know if it has always been this way, but what ""Anthropology"" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question ""Gay or ______"". For example, I have seen titles like ""Gay or Best Friends?"", ""Gay or Cowboy?"", ""Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?"", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don't know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.

Advertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.

Overall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don't necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not.

297,A2MAEZZDJP1J11,B00005N7PS,"Hi, I am writing this review in an attempt to help you save $10. This magazine is an embarrassment in every angle.

The first ""article"" starts on page 126 (!) and is about ""why a man would like to slice of his testicles""! Totally the magazine contains of 260 pages and there is text (letters that forms sentences) on about 40 of them. Besides this, the magazine also has a huge dilemma of being a gay magazine or not.

Its a very stereotypical part of the magazine, but beyond that there are cool articles to read from male perspectives. I also enjoy reading the celebrity interviews, in addition they include interviews with female celebrities. I don't agree with everything that is printed here, but certain articles have made me think and I've actually gotten a lot out of it. It helps me understand guys and I do agree with certain opinions.

350,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B00005N7P0,"Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.

When Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.

One thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.

Overall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.",Magazine,2007-09-24,4,positive,maximum pc magazine electronics freaks offering many different articles electronics repair get best replace magazine aimed one primary direction making electronic devices available accomplished many instructional articles guides question answer sessions maximum pc isnt offering words wisdom ways improve life electronics magazine usually offering reviews new products reviews section one largest parts issue nice job bringing new products forefront reviews often less stellar rather analyze products depth maximum pc instead prefers offer shorter reviews many products part magazine seems concerned quantity quality contrast remainder magazine one thing maximum pc isnt liking technical nature many articles maximum pc likes get root things literally common find articles talking circuits memory boring subjects fine take technology extremes but no interest learning interworkings wiring inside personal computer electronic pulses cause printer respond queue little much technology but know readers relish depths maximum pc goes strips electronic devices component parts overall maximum pc pretty good electronics magazine young middle aged adults loses time time gets overly technical but still ranks good magazine electronics numerous question answer sessions educational articles reviews make magazine worth reading,0.16868315508021392,positive,24.0,positive,positive

hardware reviews
software reviews (games and productivity stuff)
website reviews - It's nice to have a place that finds the cool websites that I just don't have time to find on my own.

PC build and configuration advice - Lots of articles on stuff like building PC's and fixing up Windows or even Linux.

Much of it is aimed at the DIY and gamer crowd, but for those who aren't all that into that (like me), it's still a good reference with a lot of useful information and reviews.

The only thing I don't think much of is the monthly CD.  Much of the software is somewhat dated by the time you get it and most if not all if it is available for download on the Internet (and you usually get newer versions).

If you're really into games, then the CD might be a good choice thanks to the game demos (which can be sizable downloads) but as far as the other stuff is concerned, it's mostly worthless.

Save yourself the expense and get the subscription without the CD (which Amazon doesn't seem to offer - but it does exist).

Shallow coverage, and some of the lamest humor you will ever come across.

It is nothing more then a rehash of what is freely and easily available on the internet. There is nothing original in this mag, ever. Also it tends to copy and paste much of the issue from 12 months earlier. All the main articles are nearly the same every 12 months. Don't believe me? Take two magazines that are 12 months apart and compare them.

The reviews are also weak. nearly every month you will see: THE FASTEST SYSTEM WE EVER TESTED!!!!! YAAAAAWWWWWWNNNNN. Who cares? Anyone who knows even the slightest about computers knows that speed is not the most important attribute, even for gamers. Besides, does it really matter that system y is .00005% faster on their poor testing system then computer z?

Most of the other magazines have lost the hardware angle completely.  Max PC is for those who take pride in the hardware.

407,A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A,B00005N7P0,"I started buying this in Sept of '03 because of the short blurb on the cover (of every issue) ""Maximum PC - Minimum BS"".

I have never seen that proved wrong.  Every issue is crammed full of articles that bring maximum PC goodness right to your mailbox.

There are articles about building and modifying your own PC, reviews of PC's and PC components, a ""Watchdog"" column that keeps readers abreast of problems in the industry (and attempts to find solutions for readers, too - a nice touch), a head-to-head article that compares one similar product to another, an ""Ask the Doctor"" column that provides answers to both simple and very complex computer questions, and many others.

My favorite is the how-to's in just about every issue.  All of the how-to's show even neophytes how to get down and get dirty with mods (modifications) to their machine.  But, the articles take neither a ""write down to the lowest level"" nor a ""technogeek know-it-all"" approach - they tell you what to do and how to do it simply, and reveal many ""secrets"" you won't read in mainstream computer magazines.

And the reviews.  I love the ""Kick-A**"" award - you know that product is good.  And when a product doesn't meet their standards they simply come right out and tell you it sucks - saving people lots of money in the bargain, I suspect.

This product is managed by the same people who do ""PC Gamer"" and it shows.  Many games =require= the latest and greatest machines in order to run well.  And the few game reviews shows that they know games just as well as they know computers.

Their writing style isn't for everyone, but I really enjoy the almost in-your-face attitude that they project.  This is the kind of person I want standing behind me when I make expensive modifications to my computer system - keeping me from making mistakes before I start to turn a single screw.

Recommended to anyone who has ever thought of opening the cover of their computer and doing thier own upgrades and modifications.  Highly recommended to any person who builds and modifies computers - especially highly recommended to any people who do this for computers that are virtually dedicated to gaming.

He wasn't impressed with the first two issues and complained of advertisements crowding the magazine.  He was excited to read a good article on beginning welding in his 3rd issue.  I took some time to leaf through the magazine before writing this review.  The advertisements are exhausting.  For example, in the first 10 pages of one issue, I counted 3 full page advertisements and 3 half page advertisements.  It's like that throughout the remainder of the magazine as well.  This is really unfortunate as it takes away from the readability of the magazine.  There is some useful information presented such as ""stuff we love"" which outlines favorite DIY tools, material, and gear.  There are Pro tips (example:  installing an irrigation system), reader DIY tips, and a handful of projects with decent instructions.  Unfortunately, most of the projects haven't interested my husband.  We won't be renewing this again.

427,ANRSMWQZGJF77,B00005N7P0,"MaximumPC wasn't my choice. It was sent to me uninvited to complete a subscription I had for a magazine that went defunct. On top of that, I have only a passing interest in PC's; I am certainly not a technician, nor am I an avid gamer. To complete the disconnect, I am 59 years old. With that background, you might be surprised to learn that I look forward to receiving each issue. So was I.
It's hard to put a finger on what makes this magazine so appealing to someone like me.  First I like the style.  Other reviewrs have described it as edgy, but I think of it as fun and accessible.  I have ever read any other PC book or magazine that I would describe as anything even close to fun, but this one definately is.  Secondly, it has fascinating hardware articles that are incredibly clear and understandable.  I have learned more about video cards, memory types, and processors than I ever thought I would want to learn, all while being entertained.  I have to admit that the article on building your own super PC made me want to do just that, although I would opt for the budget version, which they also included in the article. Finally, the software reviews are first class, honest, and hardhitting.  They are written by avid, unabashed gamers, and they are not shy about calling a toad a toad.

Forunately, though, the content that is included is some of the most trusted PC review content I have ever encountered.  Other PC magazines just feel like thick advertisements.  I rarely trust the reviews found in other magazines because they seem suspiciously biased towards particular manufacturers.  Not so with this magazine.
When this magazine says a particular product is good, I pay attention.
As proof of the magazines impartiality, I have seen more than once a case where a product prominently advertised in the magazine actually receives a poor review within the content of the magazine.  That kind of credibility is worth its weight in gold and is the reason I continue to get this magazine.
I don't necessarily buy the products they talk about, but I use this magazine to at least keep my finger on the pulse of the cutting edge in PC computer hardware.

I emailed them asking about this, and was told my subscription was for the magazine only.  I was never given the choice of which I wanted - the magazine only or the magazine with the CD.
They also told me that if I wanted the CD, I would have to send them another [dollar amount] on top of my paid supscription.

455,A1517CCZZQDWIR,B00005N7P0,"The only thing wrong with this mag is:
1. Several months ago, they cut down on the amount of content. 2. Also they began putting in reviews on [] like MP3
  Players. Hard core gamers could care less.
3. They do not put as many ""tweaking"" tips as they did before.
  Instead, they put long articles on ""How a CPU Works"".
4. They need to get back to basics. HCGs (Hard Core Gamers)
  want to know little secrets, like:
  a. How companies like Alienware tweak an OS, BIOS & other
  ""tweakables"" to get their PCs to SCREAM.
5. They've began taking to much for granted, as far as the know-
  ledge of their average readers. For instance, they talk
  about Raid 0 & Raid +0 and the benifits of running such a
  setup, but it would be nice if they would devote a section of
  ""step-by-step"" instructions on how to do a raid config, with
  new HDs and installing a new OS, or if it can be done with
  your current OS installed.
6. Tweaks, tweaks and more tweaks. Simple (to them) the best way
  to configure your cabling with IDE HDs, CD Roms, CD-RW, DVE+
  RWs, Zip drives, etc.
7. How the heck to you get Advanced Power Management to work
  properly? I've tried setting it up in the BIOS. If you don't
  enable it in BIOS, before loading a ""clean install"" of your
  OS some features are not available, when you try to configure
  it in Windows. For that matter, every time I try to set it up
  in Windows, then save the ""profile"" it tells me ""one or more
  of the settings are incompatible"". I've never been able to
  get a PC to ""hybrinate"" or go to sleep, where all the fans
  power down. Maybe I'm just dumb.
8. THIS IS THE BIGGIE. I've talked to a lot of HCGs, and they
  all (well all but one of 23) said they thought the inclusion
  of a monthly feature for ""DUMMIES"" would be a good choice.
  For example: Several people told me that when they run Si-
  Soft's Sandra, Win98se OS, they get a recommendation to ""turn
  Double Buffering off"". Proble is, they cant find anyplace to
  do it. They looked in Win.ini, System.ini, Autoexec.bat,
  even the registry, but no DBLBUFF.SYS (SP?) exists. They
  finally just remove the file from the ""Windows\System""
  directory & upon re-booting, they get an error that it isn't
  loaded because it's missing or corrupt. I could go on and on.
9. I would be happy to write the article (for a probationary
  period, to check reader response, then when Maximum PC gets
  overwhelming positive responses and sales increase, we can
  talk about some type of compensation that would be fair to
  all parties.
In spite of all the ""nit pickin"" I listed, Maximum PC is still the most excitingly entertaining PC magazine there is. I get my monthly subscription and it is all I can do to (not drop everything I'm doing) to start reading. I usually save it for bedtime, because (if I've had a bad day) MaxPC immediatly makes everything better. It is definatly a ""Kicka__ Magazine.

To begin, this mag is funny. Just like PC Gamer, you get the same, funny, and high spirited reviews. They are all very helpful, and like others have mentioned, this is the only hardcore PC magazine around.

While you WILL learn from reading this magazine, it gives enough substance without going over-the-top geeky technical. The format is exceptional - perfectly sized articles and plenty of vignettes for the most likely short-attention-span audience it writes to.
Maximum PC contains great tips, editorials, watch-outs, tutorials, and equipment reviews. Don't worry about not getting the disk. After buying a few newsstand issues with the disk, I decided that the magazine content was more valuable than the few demos or utilities you may get on the disk.

  What don't I like about the magazine?  Being a few years past a 20 year old gamer I have to look past some of the glitz and language like Kick A** reviews.

The articles are useful and succinct, usually covering issues well ahead of other publications. It is well organized and allows you to glance through it with their summarizing ""Verdict"" boxes on each review. The editors are very good about keeping with their readers, effectively relating to them.
A flagship occurance, as many other readers will tell you, that sets this magazine apart is that you might find a review telling you how horrible the product is on one page and on the next see an advertisement for that same product. I build many computers and I rarely disagree with their reviews. Another useful item is the benchmark, which lets you compare system and laptop performance to others they have reviewed as well as to your own.
For hardcore users, the magazine provides dependable, in-depth reviews. For beginners, it might be very intimidating, but after a couple issues, you should catch on to the style and humor enough to know more than the average person.

While many of the well-known players in this field (especially the ones with ""PC"" in their name) have dedicated increasing portions of their magazines to business-related topics, Maximum PC has stayed true to the cause of helping the individual home enthusiast or expert get the most from his machine. If you want to read about B2B apps, corporate firewalls, or XML, look elsewhere, but if you want comprehensive reviews of the latest hardware and software written for people who don't need a tutorial to rename a file on their PC or insert a chart into an Excel file, look no further.
If you're the sort of person who builds his own machine or is thinking of doing so, Maximum PC will likely prove itself useful to you. Likewise for those planning to do their own hardware upgrades. And if you're like me and just like to stay aware of and knowledgeable about current products and technologies then this is still an excellent and informative read.
To be fair, there are a few features that may be displeasing to some readers. The writing is occasionally glib with a tendency towards sophomoric humor. There's also a fair amount of focus on gaming, particularly 3D gaming technology. And the overriding theme of much of the magazine is maximizing the speed, power, and coolness of your machine.

644,A3J3ZKFNFC8N7X,B00005N7OD,"As a typical young female, I've read a lot of different magazines geared toward women. Most, in general, feature the same articles month after month, and therefore become repetitive and boring.  Let's face it: there is only so much you can take reading about ""The Best Bedroom Moves"" issue after issue.  Allure, however, never seems dull or filled with useless amounts of recycled information.

I began subscribing to the magazine at age 18 (I'm 23 now) and have never been disappointed.  Allure has articles for every age, and I find relevant information for my life, body, and health, and then I am able to find information that will interest and benefit my 50+ year old mother.  Perhaps that is part of the appeal of the magazine: any age group can enjoy it.  Not many magazines can say that.

Unlike many other female-geared magazines, Allure offers more than just underwear pictures and ""how to please your man"" articles.  Each issue, Allure has an entire section dedicated to new health science discoveries, such as new updates about skin cancer and sleep problems. The magazine seems genuinely about women, beauty, and health, whereas other magazines make some feminists role their eyes (""how to please your man,"" anyone?)

Like anything else, Allure has its downfalls.  While I do appreciate the make-up, weightloss, and fashion tips, I still always feel that I can never quite live up to the expectation the magazine presents me.

697,AI7ZJ87K1EKFK,B00005N7OD,"Allure is a great idea that's poorly manifested. I love it in principle -- a magazine devoted to beauty with a heavy focus on makeup. The content, however, is short on how-to and long on buy-this-product. Much of the makeup is expensive and exclusive, unavailable to the majority of the buying public. They're constantly raving over products that are quite frankly terrible, to the point where seeing Allure recommend something actually makes me less likely to try it. The fashion spreads are pointless and would be better left out, focusing on expensive items, unwearable trends, or flash-in-the-pan fads. The ""Makeup Colors"" technique is always frustrating, as the listed products never even resemble the actual look achieved. This problem is worsened by the fact that the colors of featured products rarely render true on the pages; I get sick of buying a cosmetic product only to find the color looks nothing like the way it looked on the page. It swings wildly between trends and recommendations with no apparent sense of coherence to it; its advice frequently contradicts itself from one month to the next. Finally, its focus on fluffy celebrity, name brand clothes, and rich-and-famous lifestyles (it's obsessed with recommending clothes and etiquette for red-carpet ""parties"" of the kind I can't begin to relate to) leads the average reader to develop a massive inferiority complex.

699,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B00005N7OD,"Unlike the other major fashion/beauty magazines which put fashion first and beauty a distant second, the focus of ""Allure"" is 90% beauty, 10% fashion.  In fact, ""Allure"" could dispense with the fashion section entirely; the clothes aren't interesting and the photo layout for the clothes is just plain dull.  And the monthly article on an acting/recording star is a waste of space.  But the makeup section and the beauty tips are great.  One of my favorite sections is the Directory, which features top beauty salons in major cities around the country.  For the past year ""Allure"" has also run a monthly makeover section featuring two women who underwent a year-long makeover mostly dedicated to losing weight and shaping up; the subjects are women readers can identify with.  ""Allure"" is one of the few fashion/beauty magazines to regularly feature models of all ethnic groups in their editorial pages with makeup shades that look good on women of every shade from ebony to ivory.  One of ""Allure""'s greatest strengths is that they don't pander to any makeup company or brand; they are upfront about what works and what doesn't.

702,A1P4F6HIXU6WYE,B00005N7OD,"Each month I really look forward to getting my Allure issue.
The magazines focus is on beauty though you will also find some fashion pieces.
What I like most is the magazines unusual look at beauty. For example past issues have included a peek inside at the items in some bathroom cabinets belonging to well knowed women.
What strippers at Scores use to take care of their bodies. An article on the man who inspired the movie Shampoo.
And there are many traditional articles on beauty. Allure excells at being on the cutting edge of new technology that will make you even prettier. On these pages you will find out about botox, laser surgery, high tech hair and more.
Allure is refreshing in that it does not have a diet article every month. In fact several years ago Allure made a point to state that it did not want to offer up a diet of the month. But Allure does share tidbits of diet information like the latest on sweeteners or water weight. It will also occasionally run true life stories on dealing with the emotional side of eating problems. And recently has tracked two women and their weight loss efforts over several months.
Fashion articles are limited to a few pages and usually include pictorials on new trends, staking out the look of a star and the latest scoop on accessories.
Definately Allure is the magazine to buy to learn how to keep your look fresh and fun!",Magazine,2003-08-05,5,positive,month really look forward getting allure issue magazines focus beauty though also find fashion pieces magazines unusual look beauty example past issues included peek inside items bathroom cabinets belonging well knowed women strippers scores take care bodies article man inspired movie shampoo many traditional articles beauty allure excells cutting edge new technology make even prettier pages find botox laser surgery high tech hair allure refreshing not diet article every month fact several years ago allure made point state not want offer diet month but allure share tidbits diet information latest sweeteners water weight also occasionally run true life stories dealing emotional side eating problems recently tracked two women weight loss efforts several months fashion articles limited pages usually include pictorials new trends staking look star latest scoop accessories definately allure magazine learn keep look fresh fun,0.11869539551357731,positive,18.0,positive,positive

I subscribed to this magazine 2 years ago, before the Tribune Co. bought it. It had several great articles each month and was really relevant not only to people living in Chicago, but to those who had just moved here. I still have several of those because they were so good to have.
Some of my favorite, and headlining, articles include: Chicago's Best New Restaurants (May 2001), Chicago's Guide to Summer (May 2001), 25 Weekend Getaways (June 2001), Guide to Surviving O'Hare (Feb. 2001)
When I resubscribed 6 months ago (post Tribune buy out) I started to notice it was catering to a different set of people. It now at least seems to have a lot less articles and they are a lot more relevant to people who live in the suburbs, or are Chicago old-money. Definitely catering to the 50+ crowd now.
From the Jan. 2003 edition: Chicago's top doctors, From the Dec. 2002 edition: The Most expensive things in town, and Look at this month's highlight 'Chicago's Richest people'.. Why do I care? I don't!!

Otherwise, I LOVE this magazine.  I used to get several magazines, but this was always my favorite.  It is chock full of ideas that we can really use.  And I love the photography.  What sets BH&G apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses.  Slippers on the floor, newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too.  They are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot.  It helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable.

730,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005N7OV,"This magazine has a lower cover price than some of its competitors, and makes up for it with a massive amount of ads. A few ads contain coupons, for those that like to cut those little things out (unfortunately they are hardly ever for anything I want !). The paper is also a lot thinner than the higher priced home/garden publications, and the photographs do not reproduce that well on it.
On the bright side, there are many nice d&eacute;cor ideas, and simply terrific recipes.
Taking the October 2003 edition as an example, Fall colors and produce are the theme. It has some ideas on how to display gourds, and an article on a community pumpkin patch, from the June planting by 140 neighbors and friends in a 6000 square ft. area, to harvest time.
There are numerous articles on remodeling, ""Foolproof Potted Plants"", on the joys of having hardy succulents in your home, and a lovely piece with lots of photographs on actor Peter Strauss' gorgeous Ojai, California garden.
The best article of all, is ""The Magic of Soup"", and some of these recipes are so good they might end up in your family for generations. They are simple to prepare, with easy to find ingredients, and will make a healthy, hearty meal for those frosty days ahead. Also included with the recipes is the preparation and cooking time, and nutritional statistics.
As someone who writes a lot of notes and cards, I appreciate the final page which is about letter writing, and how this vanishing form of communicating is good for the soul.

If you're interested work-out tips like I am, this magazine offers some but not enough...

815,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005N7OP,"As an artist, I need to be ""in the know"" a bit, and ARTnews is one of the 3 magazines I subscribe to for this purpose.
I use it primarily for: # 1, the ads, which are mostly gallery ads, and let me know what is showing, and where. # 2, the exhibit reviews (N.Y., National, International), for the same reason as # 1, and the classifieds, which sometimes give a competition notice not available elsewhere.
Regular departments include: ""ARTtalk"", which is the lighter side of the news, and ""National/International News"", which has more of a business slant, obituaries, etc.
Each issue has a ""theme"". The November 2001 for instance, has fashion design, with 3 articles on art/fashion, and one on Mary McFadden's sculpture collection. It also has ""The New Climate"", about art after 9/11, from a response by several artists to the loss of a 100 million $ in art.
Also included is a large section on new art books, and the obligatory ""avante garde"" piece. There are too many ""shock art"" articles in this magazine for my taste, therefore 4 instead of 5 stars, but I guess some people still consider this a ""trend"".
Good quality paper, excellent color reproduction, and the wide range of art represented make this a useful magazine for both artist and collector.",Magazine,2001-11-15,4,positive,artist need know bit artnews one magazines subscribe purpose primarily ads mostly gallery ads let know showing exhibit reviews ny national international reason classifieds sometimes give competition notice not available elsewhere regular departments include arttalk lighter side news nationalinternational news business slant obituaries etc issue theme november instance fashion design articles artfashion one mary mcfaddens sculpture collection also new climate art response several artists loss million art also included large section new art books obligatory avante garde piece many shock art articles magazine taste therefore instead stars but guess people still consider trend good quality paper excellent color reproduction wide range art represented make useful magazine artist collector,0.2562152133580705,positive,5.0,positive,positive

958,A1JP9UCPERSHDZ,B00005N7Q1,"Started subscription in October 2015. Used to be a subscriber in years past. Magazine tends to repeat articles, just change them up a bit year to year. I like the new tool blurbs. This is my warning, not noted in the above price/issues per year info. When I subscribed, you got 10 issues per year. As of now (Feb 2017) they only publish 8 issues per year. Magazine is dying, trying to keep itself afloat. Also they send out offers for handyman books. If you do not return the invoice cancelling the shipment, the book will be sent and then you either pay or have to deal with shipping it back. If you just toss the notice as junk mail you will be surprised when the book shows up. I will not be renewing when it is time, since I can check it out at my local library or read online through various apps.

One last gripe. The topic of some articles is beyond the scope of this type of magazine. This is geared toward homeowners, not professional contractors. But in the current issue(March 2017) there is an article starting on page 24  and goes to page 31 title Best Pro Tips Avoid Framing Tips.

1179,A29HJRPKTK52HD,B00005N7Q1,I am a professional Handyman with many thousands of service calls  and 45 years of repair experience under my belt. This is a good magazine for today's homeowner. I am saddened to see as many negative reviews for this product. This magazine covers home repair from novice to experienced . It's a print magazine so it is only fair to expect a lot of ad space dedicated to tool and product suppliers. Each issue is also filled with tips to make life a little easier . What I like is every issue has at least one idea that I haven't run across yet. You can teach an Old Dog new tricks while also reminding him about tricks he forgot. If just one article a year increases your skill set you will be money ahead. I find it humorous how often I share simple tips found here with other contractors and their amazement at simple shortcuts. In short I subscribe to this magazine because it helps me make money and leave satisfied customers.,Magazine,2016-12-17,5,positive,professional handyman many thousands service calls years repair experience belt good magazine todays homeowner saddened see many negative reviews magazine covers home repair novice experienced print magazine fair expect lot ad space dedicated tool suppliers issue also filled tips make life little easier every issue least one idea havent run across yet teach old dog new tricks also reminding tricks forgot one article year increases skill money ahead find humorous often share simple tips found contractors amazement simple shortcuts short subscribe magazine helps make money leave satisfied customers,0.2440508021390374,positive,8.0,positive,positive

1311,A3UFNRJ6L5TAJK,B00005N7QC,"This magazine has improved since the days of Bonnie Fuller.  She turned it into a Cosmo clone with lots of ""how to please your man in bed"" articles and other sex related features.  The magazine was obsessed with sex, to the point that I quit reading it until a year or two ago.

Nowadays there are fewer sex articles, though more than I would like.  I do like the fact that Glamour covers a variety of topics.  There's something for just about everyone.  The dos and don'ts are fun, as well as the feature where a person does something really ridiculous to see how people respond.  I will say that at 38 I'm starting to feel that I'm outgrowing the magazine a little bit.  A lot of the articles seem to be targeted at someone younger than me.  I'm not sure how much longer I will continue my subscription, but I do think this is one of the better women's magazines for gals in their 20s to mid 30s.

One warning about Conde Nast magazines:  when you purchase a new subscription, they send you two old magazines from previous months, and count them against your subscription.  I really dislike this practice.  It has happened with every Conde Nast magazine I've subscribed to.  Also, I often receive my magazine well after it has appeared on the newsstand.

1312,ANIUF9B7STXBI,B00005N7QC,"This is by far my favorite magazine.  It's dynamic- it doesn't just focus on one topic, but many! Glamour has something for everyone, be it makeup tips or clothes for your body type, work out regimes, sex tips, and articles on global issues.  Yes, some of the articles can be a bit repetitive, but come on, your reading a magazine, not a Shakespearean novel.
I love the articles by Marianne Pearl.  She is traveling the world for Glamour, writing stories about social issues in our world.  Not only are the articles well written, but they are uplifting and give light to problems that the media often ignores.
The Glamour Beauty section focuses on tips for applying makeup for the current season and fun hairstyles to try.  Glamour Fashion has clothes that are mostly affordable for the everyday woman and it's fun to look at all the different styles.  In addition, there is always a ""Do and Don't"" section which shows people wearing both ridiculous and chic outfits. The Men, Sex, and Love section usually has a Do and Don't section as well, and advice for women written by real men.  Sometimes the celebrity interview can be a bit bland- they are often just promoting a new CD or movie, but others have been quite interesting.  This section is often hit or miss.
What I like best about Glamour is the Real Stories section.  There is always a page about an everyday hero, which is uplifting to read.  Plus, usually a celebrity will tell about a transforming time in his or her life.
I love that Glamour isn't like every other magazine.

The articles are real, and smart! The layouts are interesting; they don't have merely one color and one font. There is an array of texts and hues to keep the reader appealed and yet it isn't too busy. The magazine doesn't have raunchy articles, just very informative, professional, articles. And the advertisements don't rule the magazine. They are placed in the magazine to enhance its already dynamic appeal.

1316,ARIJ8M9EMJB44,B00005N7QC,"Pros:
- has a splatter of fairly interesting articles/ pictures

Cons:
- all of the fairly interesting articles/ pictures can be usually read and viewed in under half an hour
- (and in the table of contents/ on the cover they make a huge deal out of every, however tiny, article that's inside... often making cross-references/ multiple references to the same thing)
- besides dwindling inspiration, this is probably generally due to the fact that the magazine is absolutely overwhelmed by ads! Much more so than before, it seems.  I would estimate that at least half, but as much as 2/3 of the magazine is dedicated to ads - many of which are very much in-your-face and clash with magazine materials
- although Glamour is more easy-going and not as pretentious as, say, Vogue... it has its share of preaching and hypocritical moments.  For example, in the last issue they had an article about women/kids who escaped sex slavery in Darfur - with the interpersed full-page ads of bright red, high-heeled designer shoes!  If you don't belive me, check out pages 256+ in the March 2008 issue... a pretty ridiculous sight.",Magazine,2008-02-23,2,negative,pros splatter fairly interesting articles pictures cons fairly interesting articles pictures usually read viewed half hour table contents cover make huge deal every however tiny article thats inside often making crossreferences multiple references thing besides dwindling inspiration probably generally due fact magazine absolutely overwhelmed ads much seems would estimate least half but much magazine dedicated ads many much inyourface clash magazine materials although glamour easygoing not pretentious say vogue share preaching hypocritical moments example last issue article womenkids escaped sex slavery darfur interpersed fullpage ads bright red highheeled designer shoes dont belive check pages march issue pretty ridiculous sight,0.11706349206349205,positive,2.0,positive,positive

The previous reviews were a little bit out of date here on Amazon, and in my opinion, a magazine can transform dramatically in a year, if not less. There's definitely a lot less fluff and a lot of wonderful articles in 2005.  For example, there were articles about the emotional hardships with a mom whose kid is mentally ill and the story of up coming star as a happily adopted child. There were articles on women who struggled so that girls today can play in Little League, women can get credit cards and keep their job when they get pregnant.  There's a lot of important and powerful article on women's rights with a dose of celebrity life.  My favorite article was Aisha Tyler showing us how much digital touchup can do to cover models....it definitely made me feel a lot better about my body.

I felt like Glamour had enough dosage with fashion, health news, beauty tips, and celebrity life, but still did a great job to remind us the greatness of being a woman. I gave it 4 stars due to the fact that I had flip through 6 pages of ads before I got to the table on contents. I suppose that's how magazines make their money, but I can do without.

A good fashion publication informs, delights, and guides consumers who enjoy acting in this area (being fashionable).
The Glamour on-line site links its return arrow to a back-to-site circuit, actively ruining a consumer's efforts to get general information. That's acting in bad faith. Why be ""punished"" opening a site?
As a general rule, Glamore's occasional pieces of substance are at strong angles to its relentless sales pitch--always closing, closing, closing. Indeed, as a document of the fashion world, Glamour seems too often to suggest the old, dreary example--if its expensive--over the new, novel, more innocative example.

1964,ASLIGLN95WJHH,B00005N7SC,"I used to really like Popular Science and have been reading it for probably a dozen or more years now. For the past couple years, though, the quality seems to have really dropped and I have decided to cancel my subscription.

There seems to be a much larger focus on graphics taking up the pages instead of written content (it's not uncommon for 2/3+ of a given page to be graphics or photos with a single paragraph of text). And there seems to be more material directed toward the 'internet culture' sort of crowd, which I don't care for. If I wanted to read cutesy things about surviving a zombie apocalypse (I don't) I would be doing so on the internet already. The general quality of writing seems to have become much more simplified and less in depth. I get it, it's Popular Science, not a scientific journal. But I remember the quality of writing being much higher not a few years ago. It's trying to compete with the internet now the magazine feels like a website in print, complete with readers' tweets.

The ads seem more bothersome and invasive now. The last issue I received started off with a double page ad and a single page ad, both before the contents page. This issue had 26 pages worth of ads out of the 103 pages total (not including 'articles' gushing over new products), and some of them are sneaky ads too. There was a double page ad made to look an article with no written indication that it was an ad (older issues I still have clearly printed 'ADVERTISEMENT' along the top of the page).

This is not something I personally care about, but it's worth mentioning that there are ads for both tobacco and alcohol products in Popular Science and there have been for some time. In fact, the double page ad I mentioned earlier which starts off the last Issue I received was for Skoal dipping tobacco. The very first thing you see when you open the magazine. So look out if you buy this for your children to read and don't want to expose them to that sort of advertising.

They also REALLY seem to be pushing the global warming thing. I get that it's a problem and all that, but it seems like every single issue has something about global warming ending the world and it's starting to get annoying. I would like to have more variety in reading material, y'know?

All in all the quality of Popular Science has degraded to the point where I don't find it worth reading anymore. It's like a television show several seasons in which you watch because you've always watched it, not because you enjoy it anymore. At some point it's either going to get cancelled or you're going to start to dislike it enough to stop watching, and that's where I am now.",Magazine,2017-06-19,2,negative,really popular science reading probably dozen years past couple years though quality seems really dropped decided cancel subscription seems much larger focus graphics taking pages instead written content not uncommon given page graphics photos single paragraph text seems material directed toward internet culture sort crowd dont care wanted read cutesy things surviving zombie apocalypse dont would internet already general quality writing seems become much simplified less depth get popular science not scientific journal but remember quality writing much higher not years ago trying compete internet magazine feels website print complete readers tweets ads seem bothersome invasive last issue received started double page ad single page ad contents page issue pages worth ads pages total not including articles gushing new products sneaky ads double page ad made look article no written indication ad older issues still clearly printed advertisement along top page not something personally care but worth mentioning ads tobacco alcohol products popular science time fact double page ad mentioned earlier starts last issue received skoal dipping tobacco first thing see open magazine look children read dont want expose sort advertising also really seem pushing global warming thing get problem but seems every single issue something global warming ending world starting get annoying would variety reading material yknow quality popular science degraded point dont find worth reading television show several seasons watch youve always watched not enjoy point either going get cancelled youre going start dislike enough stop watching thats,0.08346531517263224,negative,21.0,positive,negative

2005,A3EPN0GK0Z0854,B00005N7QO,"Under the supreme tutelage of Editor Lewis Lapham, Harper's Magazine consistently churns out intense, dramatic, sincere, frightening, uplifting, and challenging commentary.  If others in the media censor their opinions in the face of big brother, Harper's makes up for it with brutally honest assessments of culture, politics, and world affairs.
At first look, Harper's seems a leftist publication, but if you read it a little more carefully, it's a lot more Mark Twain than Karl Marx.  I'd call it centrist, but even that implies straddling the center between two extremes.  Like Twain, Harper's is more of a somewhat irascible, yet always caring voice on the outside, not on one end of the spectrum or another, but rather on a different spectrum altogether.
The attitude is egalitarian, never pompous.  The voices are reasonable, if sometimes angry or alarmed.  Harper's is definitely not a liberal magazine in the sense of Marxist socialism.  Harper's is liberal in the sense of Jeffersonian liberalism.  It's opinions seem more focused on improving local cultures and economies and challenging the demagogues and central planners who seek to control the masses, be they Democrat or Republican.  Perhaps Harper's is the Jim Jeffords of the magazine world.
Harper's is an eloquent and impassioned magazine that delivers carefully constructed and inventive views of the world each month.  There is an overriding sense of seriousness and genuine compassion found in every issue.  In a world where so many media sources are merely parrots for a larger corporate or political agendas, Harper's stands out as an autonomous voice of indignant opposition to censorship and blind nationalism.  If you care about the world we all inhabit and genuinely want to discover how we might all get to a better place, give Harper's a read.  It may not provide the answers, but it certainly raises all the right questions.",Magazine,2002-04-12,5,positive,supreme tutelage editor lewis lapham harpers magazine consistently churns intense dramatic sincere frightening uplifting challenging commentary others media censor opinions face big brother harpers makes brutally honest assessments culture politics world affairs first look harpers seems leftist publication but read little carefully lot mark twain karl marx id call centrist but even implies straddling center two extremes twain harpers somewhat irascible yet always caring voice outside not one end spectrum another but rather different spectrum altogether attitude egalitarian never pompous voices reasonable sometimes angry alarmed harpers definitely not liberal magazine sense marxist socialism harpers liberal sense jeffersonian liberalism opinions seem focused improving local cultures economies challenging demagogues central planners seek control masses democrat republican perhaps harpers jim jeffords magazine world harpers eloquent impassioned magazine delivers carefully constructed inventive views world month overriding sense seriousness genuine compassion found every issue world many media sources merely parrots larger corporate political agendas harpers stands autonomous voice indignant opposition censorship blind nationalism care world inhabit genuinely want discover might get better place give harpers read may not provide answers but certainly raises right questions,0.09226190476190475,negative,13.0,positive,positive

2009,A1DGMZ9TFG5I4X,B00005N7QO,"Here's a quick breakdown:
1. Harpers will feed your need for the trivial. The Index is a fascinating collection of facts and figures, and the front-of-book section is probably one of the most quirky, laugh-out-loud funny and stimulating in the business.
2. Great fiction. Some up-and-comers submit, along with some old pros (a recent story by Joyce Carol Oates was outstanding)
3. Great features. Some great topics, albeit a lot of environmental stuff, it's still well-rounded and well-informed. Great ones I've read recently include a look at maids, SUVs, education reform and more.
I can see why people might not like this magazine because it appears to be ""uppity.""

So when I discovered I can read it on my Kindle Fire I was super hyped for the transition from paper magazine to eMagazine. After purchasing the magazine and reading it on the Fire I discovered a slight problem: the magazine doesn't seem ready for tablet yet. The page view helps with seeing the colors and you can zoom in to see all the small print that Men's Health uses for factoids riddled across the page. I found myself more distracted trying to find the right orientation to hold the kindle. I was also constantly zooming in and out on text just to read articles. I think the magic of tablets call for a more interactive experience with magazines. I really enjoy the GQ and WIRED app that I have on the kindle. I think more magazines need to adopt the app format if it wants to be read on the Kindle Fire's 7in screen. I still love the magazine.

Secondly, and the main reason I got up to write this review, is that when your year is thankfully up, they send a small postcard saying they will ""for your convenience"" automatically bill your credit card for a renewal!

So it becomes your responsibility to contact them (of course, the phone number is ""temporarily"" broken) or else negotiate with your credit card company for a reversal. Your time and hassle - free to them. And maybe, just maybe, you'll forget or give up.

2149,A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B00005N7RD,"Bottom-Line: I have come to the conclusion the ""Men's Health"" is not written for me.

The world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, ""Men's Health"" magazine stands out as a periodical with some substance, style and intellect, but after reading the latest issue I am certainly not sold.  And what is with all of the lists?

I had been meaning to pick up an issue of ""Men's Health Magazine"" for quite some time when I picked up a copy--the October 2007 issue--while shopping for a computer manual at Borders.  The cover--as they always tend to do--featured a rather buff Jason Statham and article titles in big bold letters designed to catch the attention of that man looking for advise on Six-Pack ABS, or how to Dress for More Sex, or how to Eat Better and Think Smarter, or (my favorite) read what 1,293 Sexy Women Confess What They Want in Bed.

""Men's Health Magazine,"" whose tag line is Tons of Useful Stuff, was founded in 1987 and is published 10 times a year by the Rodale Inc.  The magazine began publishing in the United Kingdom in 1995.  Today ""Men's Health Magazine"" is published in 36 editions worldwide, distributed to 48 countries, and enjoyed a (2005) U.S. circulation of some 1.8 million.

The problem with ""Men's Health"" is that there is very little useful information to be found with the fold of the magazine despite it daunting size.  Most of the articles are snippets of information stuck between far too many glassy advertisements featuring young male models in clothing I would never wear and probably couldn't afford.  Same for the automobiles.  To be sure there was one rather lengthy article in the issue I read, but it was about dogs of all things!  The article I wanted to have some substance--a snippet on Michelle Ryan, the new Bionic Woman--was barely a page in length; how disappointing.

And yes there was a snippet or two about healthy food, but nothing I didn't already know.  And the lists, there are endless lists of thing we can do to improve this or that, mostly dealing with self-image and sex; there are very few actually devoted to well, men's health.  Has our attention span grown so short that we must now condense or leisure reading into bullet points; endless lists that tell us how to live our lives?

I have come to the conclusion the ""Men's Health"" is not written for me, a man in the middle of his life, settled, with a family, a regular job, with far too little time work workout, and far too little money to afford the rich life-style pimped by the magazine.  There is little practical information inside the glossy innards of ""Men's Health"" at least from my perspective.  Perhaps if I were young, rich, hip, the magazine would appeal to me, but I am none of those things, so...By the way what is the deal with all the lists?

I have been a fairly consistent subscriber to the magazine for about 6 years and I have definitely been educated and entertained by its content. The authors and layout staff have definitely made Men's Health a pleasure to read.

Unfortunately, over the last couple of years that I have noticed, the parent company, Rodale has been engaging in some fairly poor business practices. First off, they love to send random hardcover books to you and charge you for them without you ever really consenting to it. There is basically no way for you to ship back the books without costing a fortune on shipping fees. To my knowledge, there is no option of opting out of this.

Also, unlike a lot of other normal magazines, Rodale never gives you the option of renewing your subscription. They pretty much just send you a bill at the end of your original renewal period and charge you for the next period automatically. If you do not respond they will send your debt to a collection agency and that is a whole different nightmare to deal with.

Of course I'm sure if we all read that thing we signed before subscribing to the magazine that there will be a section in small print informing us that Rodale can do whatever it wants.

2250,A3H72XNDTSY8DB,B00005N7QO,"A few years ago I was looking for a magazine to subscribe to and was drawn to the extremely positive reviews of Harper's. Have now been subscribing for several years straight. I do not consider myself really high brow, so I am probably not adequate to the task of reviewing a magazine, but I will do my best. The writing in this is super high quality--it appears the most important consideration for anything published in the magazine is the quality of the prose. I don't know where they find their writers--I imagine a very small number would be capable of writing for this magazine. I believe the first piece I ever read in Harper's was one written by a former archeology student who visited some of the old abandoned movie sets from the Star Wars movies. I remember being blown away by the high register of the vocabularly and the fantastic story telling and the extremely clever premise. The writing in the magazine often approaches the poetic. Personally I like the nonfiction pieces, esp. on politics and pop culture, and generally have not taken the time to read the fiction offerings or the reviews. I assume the magazine editors would identify the magazine as trying to reach a quite liberal audience. I am independent politically but do not find myself turned off by the magazine, as I am by political talk radio/TV. There are certainly pieces of political advocacy in here, but in my opinion the arguments are nuanced enough, with recognition of counterarguments, that reading this is not like listening to one-sided garbage such as we will find from Limbaugh, Hannity, Maddow, and their ilk. The writers generally recognize there are no simple solutions. For example, a piece in which an undercover writer examined food inspection practices in a slaughterhouse ended with the writer eating and more or less enjoying a steak--not the regular expose piece. I must admit that I most like the Harper's ""index"" and the readings at the beginning, especially the readings included for their irony or unintentional humor. Frankly, if I subscribed to Atlantic or the New Yorker I would probably read a greater perctange of those magazines because those mags do not seem quite as high brow, but I cannot deny the quality of Harper's.",Magazine,2014-03-10,5,positive,years ago looking magazine subscribe drawn extremely positive reviews harpers subscribing several years straight not consider really high brow probably not adequate task reviewing magazine but best writing super high qualityit appears important consideration anything published magazine quality prose dont know find writersi imagine small number would capable writing magazine believe first piece ever read harpers one written former archeology student visited old abandoned movie sets star wars movies remember blown away high register vocabularly fantastic story telling extremely clever premise writing magazine often approaches poetic personally nonfiction pieces esp politics pop culture generally not taken time read fiction offerings reviews assume magazine editors would identify magazine trying reach quite liberal audience independent politically but not find turned magazine political talk radiotv certainly pieces political advocacy but opinion arguments nuanced enough recognition counterarguments reading not listening onesided garbage find limbaugh hannity maddow ilk writers generally recognize no simple solutions example piece undercover writer examined food inspection practices slaughterhouse ended writer eating less enjoying steaknot regular expose piece must admit harpers index readings beginning especially readings included irony unintentional humor frankly subscribed atlantic new yorker would probably read greater perctange magazines mags not seem quite high brow but not deny quality harpers,0.14527396413110702,positive,23.0,positive,positive

2295,A2E5T453FR502Z,B00005N7RD,"I was a subscriber to Men's Health for a year. My year ended at the same time the magazine published its tacit endorsement of Barack Obama in its November 2008 issue. I did not believe that a cigarette smoker who spent his youth smoking marijuana and snorting cocaine was an appropriate man to promote in a health magazine. The same issue also attacked several conservatives and Republicans. (Oddly, a poll in that issue showed that 42% of the magazine's readers identified most with the GOP, while just 18% identified most with the Democrat Party.) Therefore, I chose not to renew my subscription.

I never received a postcard such as one reviewer said he received. However, several weeks after I notified Men's Health that I would not be renewing my sub, I received a package with two books and a note that read, ""As promised when you ordered Men's Health Magazine, your 21-day free preview of Men's Health Total Fitness Guide 2009 has arrived.""

First, I did not receive such a ""promise"" when I signed up for a subscription more than a year ago. Second, I would not accept a subscription with such a ""promise."" And, third, I wrote Men's Health on November 10 to let them know that I did not wish to renew my subscription.

2296,AJ0PG46QD33RD,B00005N7RD,"I picked up a copy of Men's Health when I was at the height of being a work out zealot last year and it seemed like a complete and utter revelation.  Tips about diet, work out plans, zillions of factoids to confirm I was on the correct track.  I was hooked, bought the next edition and after that got my years subscription.

The bottom line?  I quit reading after about six months - I felt like there were only so many 'I was fat and now I am thin' articles I can read and I felt the emphasis on some diet aspects, herbs and unproven substances was a bit suspect once I dug deeper into the research.  They put a huge emphasis on protein in the diet when the bottom line is most Western diets have more than enough and there is a substantial body of evidence leaning toward the fact that high protein diets lead to a lessened flow of blood to the heart.  Frankly I pulled out a food pyramid from the government, went to the gym a ton, lost 40lbs within a few months. No fancy herbs, no supplements, no major pain.

2302,A3H0R5ME2Q8ZLJ,B00005N7RD,"So I ordered this magazine and for almost a year I've been reading it.  I have to admit, it's not entirely what I expected.  I've picked up a random issue for review, September 2007 to be exact.  So here goes...

The GOOD:  The articles in here are well-written for the most part, and many of them are related to actual health.  This issue, which features an odd dual-issue format with Jamie Foxx on one cover and Andy Samberg from SNL on the back, has an article about the decline in testosterone (good) and stories about cooking healthier (also good).  Some of the ads in this issue are geared toward men too, such as the Ford Super Duty and Jeep ads.

The BAD:  In my opinion, there's *way* too much focus on fashion in this magazine.  It's bad on normal months, but this issue has a whole section donated to it (the back, upside-down section).  They seem to want me to buy a $750.00 pair of ugly Beatles-boots and by far the ugliest watch I've ever seen, the Zenith Defy Xtreme Open for $29,700.00.  Not sure who this magazine is catering to but I bought a subscription to learn more about healthy living.  There are entire magazines out there devoted to the type of guy who has money to burn and cares so much about a certain image (in otherwords, a poser).  I didn't expect it from this magazine.  And it's not that I want to tell this magazine what it should or shouldn't be... it's just that I don't want any part of this whole image thing.  You can buy some great high-quality and functional men's items without going overboard with materialism, and I don't want a magazine that promotes that.

The UGLY:  That Zenith watch takes the cake.  Seriously, look it up online.  It looks like something from a cereal box.  I might wear it if it was free, but I'd have to wear long sleeves to cover it up.  A watch shouldn't cost more than a new car.  If it does... you're a poser :)

2330,A7QAU7NY69OJC,B00005N7RD,"I've had a subscription for Men's Health for over 10 years, but just recently cancelled it. Cancelation was a bit of a hassle as I had to contact them three times.

The magazine is full of little facts, great recipes for quick meals and some decent workout tips. However I found that the articles weren't detailed enough. The workouts weren't thorough enough and rarely offered alternatives for people with troubled area's.

What put me over the edge is the increasing advertisement laden content. Seems like all the products that were recommend would preceded or followed by an advertisement from the manufacturer. So too many advertisements along with weaker content was enough to steer me away.

In addition, ever since they brought on the new editor they have had a lot of junky stuff added. Too much relationship stuff and the Jimmy the bartender segment could be thrown out. Seems like it was made for very young men.

I'm also not fond of their involuntary preferred customer program, where they automatically sign you up for the following year. It wouldn't be too bad if their online system worked, but it didn't work the 3 times I tried. If you;re going sing-up someone automatically at least give them the special discount.

2331,A242NJZNGHH4C4,B00005N7RD,"I've enjoyed subscribing to Men's Health magazine in the past but I had to stop to prevent being sold products and renewals without my authorization.  Be aware that with your subscription, they will automatically renew your subscription ""for your convenience"" and bill you accordingly.

Also, I would receive post-card notices in the mail about their latest fitness guide ($28) and how I can ""preview"" it for 21 days. Of course, I think not and toss the card out.  Too bad I didn't pay close enough attention.  I have to fill out and send the card back in order to decline.  The fitness guide shows up in the mail and I have 21 days to repack it and ship it back.  They got me with two of them (I admit, I did fail to get it shipped back before 21 days was up) and, along with the auto-renewal, I had enough and called and told them I didn't want to be a customer anymore.  Fine....I thought.  It's been four months since my last issue and here I am now with a postcard from Rodale Books about previewing the 2008 Fitness Guide.  I guess cancelling my subscription wasn't enough to keep them from auto-selling me stuff.

Can you imagine this new tactic of selling becoming the norm?  The retailer gets to choose what we order and it's up to us to decline it.  Crazy!

I am an active guy but I don't have regular workout plan. I do love this magazine though.  I had bought a few from a local store every so often and had to order a subscription.  Their regular articles are great, I really like the 3 sex ones, and all of the stats on men and women.  The little add-on on almost every page giving a percent of the male popluation that has or hasn't done something or something is great.

The articles on health issues, say the prostate are very informative yet simple enough the average person can understand them.  Yet even as a biochemist I find them captavating.  I don't usually spend to much time reading the atricles on working out, as I don't really do that, although one day...  There are articles on just about everything; gadgets, clothing, cars, getting ahead on the job, etc.....  Everything you would want for a guy magazine, its just not the main focus.  I have changed my diet from reading some of the articles.  One thing you won't really find in here is politics, which is fine by me.  Usually a magazine will pick one side or the other and completely turn me off of it, I think its better that they just stay out of it all together.  One last little bit of info, there arnt a whole lot of ad's, as compared to other magazines.  There are some at the beginning and end, but very few in the middle (as far as whole page ads go).

* The workouts are recycled. They may change a few exercises but it is always the same swiss ball crunches and weightless squats on a bench. Though most health/exercise magazines do have this problem.

* They always have a 6 page advertisement toward the end. Yes 6 pages. It is normally from the company that makes Hydroxy cut. But the worst part is that it always has the disclaimer that the claims haven't been evaluated by the food and drug administration. Isn't the name of this magazine Men's HEALTH? Yet they run ads for untested unsafe over-the-counter supplements.  This advertisement is in addition to all of the other supplements that have full page ads.

* Next, as one earlier reviewer mentioned, the clothing in the fashion section is always extremely expensive. I'm not a thrift store shopper but I don't spend over $700 on one outfit either.

Not to be all negative I have to admit there are some issues that really rock like the interview with Thomas Jane about his Punisher workout and the article about physical requirements of dangerous jobs like Marines, Army, SWAT, FBI, etc.

2401,A3NPVNPMXN8L2G,B00005N7QO,"Lewis H. Lapham was the reason I initially subscribed to Harper's. His template and influence is still present. I enjoy my reading hobby and this magazine touches a lot of my reading hot buttons.
 Investigative reporting is my red meat hot botton. Perhaps the best book on that subject is Into The Buzzsaw by Kristina Borjesson. If one reads that, than one understands, what they need to know about a ""free press"". Despite those draw backs(read the book), Harper's manages to touch some hot wires that are ever present in today's envirnoment of elaborate PR facades. For example, the ""global warming' that is allegedly caused by carbon dioxide. Read(google)/ Climate Change: There's Money To Be Made by Ken Silverstein Harper's.
 Another hot botton of mine is books/literature, and Harper's not only reviews several books, but selects some for very in-depth anaylses.
 Another hot button of mine is science and they have a feature, every month: Findings, which is quite good(short but sweet). Also, some articles, at times, feature science stories.
 Another great feature they have every month is their ""Index"" feature, which relates some factual statistics on current topics that are in the public eye.
 Another feature is ""Readings"", which is an eclectic assortment of various odds & ends that cover things that one would never imagine to come across.
 Perhaps one of the most outstanding reasons to subscribe is Harper's provides access to its vast archives, dating back to 1850! I accessed an article that noted historian Charles Beard wrote in December 1931 titled 'The Myth of Rugged American Individualism'. In it he documented 15 examples of government handouts/subsidies to business when the country was sinking into Depression. It demolished the notion that business had single-handedly achieved the building of the country(or even its own special projects)due to the acumen and strength of character of big American entreneurs, revealing the extent to which government (as funded by the taxpayer) was not just instrumental, but an indespensable participant. Government was engaged in these projects in such a way that corporations were primary beneficiaries to the detriment of the public-such as the elaborate construction of networks of highways favoring the auto industry and Big Oil instead of cheap public transit. The giant businesses have enjoyed tremendous benefits while commanding public policy agenda, distorting public policy priorities and expendatures in ways that are not in (or even against) the public interest. And then, even as they reap immense government subsidies, they have the audacity to preach 'individualism' and self-sufficientcy to the American public, to tell Americans that we should demand nothing /expect nothing from the government we elected to address OUR NEEDS.
 This article of the past is representative of what a magazines should writing today. Unfortunately, it is NOT the case.

Unlike some other liberal publications who might pretend that criticism of Israel isn't anti-semitic, Harper's would talk about the ""Jews"" influence in DC. The magazine would go so far as to accuse American Jews of formenting and starting wars in the Middle East. Anyone who is educated knows this is garbage, as the vast majority of American Jews are liberal, vote Democrat, and oppose most of Israel's contemporary policies. If you are going to stand by your reputation as a magazine with 100% integrity, you have to be willing to explore BOTH sides of EVERY issue. Even if Israel and the Jews are the one group you demonize, that is one group too many. Considering the history of the Jewish people, it seems like a cop-out.

There you have it. We're going for the affluent but not super-rich young guy who won't even become aware that the Lincoln Town Car and Audi A8 exist until he turns 55.  Well, 52 maybe.

But you didn't need the cars to figure out MEN'S HEALTH.

It's about what all men think about and what affluent guys with six-pack abs (in reality or in their dreams) can generally snag: expensive suits, beautiful women who seem never not to pout, and beefy arms to set off those abs.

To be fair, there is actually a fair amount of *health* under discussion in these pages. But I doubt that's the main reason guys pull this magazine off the shelf instead of, say, DOG FANCIERS.

In spite of an irritating habit of treating women as trophies to be won or dupes to be lured, there is a good bit of wit in here about what one might call the manly dilemma in the modern world. And if it really is lack of *just* the right workout regimen that has kept you from getting all that's on offer in MEN'S WORLD, well, there's at least one new workout each month that will cure all that ails you.

Of the 1-2 articles in the magazine, none of them contains any science at all. I think they stay away from it on purpose because none of the writers appears competent in the field. At best they have articles about people in science or about social issues related to science, but always very shallow, even on these issues. It is not there is no depth in the science, there is no popular science at all. I was particular confused by an article from the new editor in chief in which he basically chose to describe his vacation in China, along with pictures of the westerners he met in various burger joints. He managed to throw in some technical words in there like ""energy"" and ""force"" but NEVER in their technical scientific meanings. This is incompetent and unprofessional.

Simply put, MHM overloads you with too much information, without putting it together in a bigger picture. Should I really be excited to hear some pop icon or actor's workout every month? And if you expect to afford the clothes in this magazine, you should be earning $100k a year.

Something else that bothers me about MHM, is the magazine still debates the roles of alcohol, beef, pork, marijuana, coffee, and processed foods in seeking optimum health.

The magazine never forgets to issue advice on every sort of interpersonal/social situation, and if your a little slow, I guess you need it. On the other hand, if you meditate and have some degree of intuition, you don't need all that advice, it's common sense.

MHM and Rodale press could just publish one workout book every decade, as ""breakthroughs"" don't happen very often in the realm of physical training. Just look at the US military. Also, who knows how much money the beef industry pays Rodale, let alone all the other products they ""recommend"".
