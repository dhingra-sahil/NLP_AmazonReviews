They have been used a few times already and do what they are supposed to - no complaints there.What I will say is that 12 feet really isn't an ideal length.  Sure, if you pull up front bumper to front bumper they are plenty long, but a lot of times you will be beside another car or can't get really close.  Because of this, I would recommend something a little longer than 12'.Great brand - get 16' version though.",Auto,2011-08-17,5,positive,needed jumper cables new car good reviews good price times already supposed no complaints therewhat say feet really isnt ideal length sure pull front bumper front bumper plenty long but lot times beside another car cant get really close would recommend something little longer great brand get version though,0.3898863636363637,positive,8.0,positive,positive

3,A3GT2EWQSO45ZG,B00002243X,"I absolutley love Amazon!!!  For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a ""jump"" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The ""booster car"" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.The technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a ""dead"" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the ""dead"" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!

11,A3MQAQT8C6D1I7,B00002243Z,"All other jumper cables are not real jumper cables.  THESE are jumper cables.  Let me explain.When you're in a bind on some dark night in some parking lot somewhere and your battery is dead, you need to get out of there pronto.In times like that, it's much easier to get a jump if YOU own a set of jumper cables.  It's double good if those jumper cables are long so that they can easily reach the battery of a good samaritan.  Now, according to electrical theory in order for DC current to flow across long distances, you need thicker cable.That's where these cables come in, they're long at 25' and thick at 2gauge.That's what these cables provide, maximum length at near maximum gauge cable.  And yes, your jumper cables SHOULD cost close to as much as your spare tire because that's what you need --- just look up the cost of copper on the market (that stuff is expensive).Yes, you can buy a $17 set of 10 foot, 18 gauge cables out there but if they can't reach between cars or if they can't carry enough power to start your car, you might as well have been lugging a brick in your trunk all those years and you might as well have enjoyed a good lunch with the $17 for all the false confidence it gave you.  I'm serious, buy an extension cord for $5 and you get as much jumping potential as many of the so called 'jumper' cables on the market --- there should be laws against marketing products that cannot jump start a car.  Worse, having no cables or less-than-worthless cables means that a criminal might reach you before you can get a jump and make your getaway.At the end of the day, you want a 25' or 20' cable, so you better be looking at 2gauge or 4 gauge cable - no compromises there.  You can go to 6gauge if you're working your way down to 16' cables.  But, the reality is that you always need a few extra feet when trying to jump start someone's car parked in some tight parking space --- so you're back to the 25' and 2 gauge.Pros- I know I can jump start a Semi with these (more importantly, I can get a jump from a Semi - Truck drivers are the good guys btw)- Extra long at 25'- Parrot clamp are strong, but an average guy can open them with one hand- Copper inserts in the parrot clamps is nice- Clamps are rated at 500amps- they're friggin heavy at near 14lbs, yes that's a pro!  that means there's 14 POUNDS of Copper in there and that's what allows the current to flow as freely as the Amazon river (no pun intended). It's huge.Cons- I do have an issue that the copper cable is not attached to the copper inserts in the clamps, it screws into the metal clamp rather than into the copper insert.  I don't know if that's a mistake or not.  I'm thinking about doing a bit of retrofitting.  I'm sure it's more than enough the way it is.Overall, these are as close an approximation to the kind of jumper cables that my dad had when I was growing up.  He custom made his -- he's old school.Anyway, if you're going to carry jumper cables, and you should --- don't muck around -- spend the dough, get these --- they'll last a lifetime and will not let you down.Advice, after you get a jump don't waste time rolling these things up in some dark parking lot -- just toss the heavy mangled mess into your trunk and get home.  There's always time the next day to roll these monsters back up and get them ready for the next wild adventure you might have.",Auto,2010-10-22,5,positive,jumper cables not real jumper cables jumper cables let explainwhen youre bind dark night parking lot somewhere battery dead need get prontoin times much easier get jump jumper cables double good jumper cables long easily reach battery good samaritan according electrical theory order dc current flow across long distances need thicker cablethats cables come theyre long thick 2gaugethats cables provide maximum length near maximum gauge cable yes jumper cables cost close much spare tire thats need look cost copper market stuff expensiveyes foot gauge cables but cant reach cars cant carry enough power start car might well lugging brick trunk years might well enjoyed good lunch false confidence gave im serious extension cord get much jumping potential many called jumper cables market laws marketing products not jump start car worse no cables lessthanworthless cables means criminal might reach get jump make getawayat end day want cable better looking 2gauge gauge cable no compromises go 6gauge youre working way cables but reality always need extra feet trying jump start someones car parked tight parking space youre back gaugepros know jump start semi importantly get jump semi truck drivers good guys btw extra long parrot clamp strong but average guy open one hand copper inserts parrot clamps nice clamps rated 500amps theyre friggin heavy near 14lbs yes thats pro means theres pounds copper thats allows current flow freely river no pun intended hugecons issue copper cable not attached copper inserts clamps screws metal clamp rather copper insert dont know thats mistake not im thinking bit retrofitting im sure enough way isoverall close approximation kind jumper cables dad growing custom made hes old schoolanyway youre going carry jumper cables dont muck around spend dough get theyll last lifetime not let downadvice get jump dont waste time rolling things dark parking lot toss heavy mangled mess trunk get home theres always time next day roll monsters back get ready next wild adventure might,0.09326839826839824,negative,16.0,positive,positive

13,A3GT2EWQSO45ZG,B00002243Z,"So these aren't the best cables you can buy.  For that you'll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY!  Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost!  So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use, I'd say these are gonna work for you.(Update: After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car, they don't really seem that much thicker...  That's said they are MUCH heavier!  The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I'm guessing that's why the thickness isn't much more...)What I like:--Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup.  Why?  Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides.  Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you.--Heft - these cables are no joke.  It's a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow.  When trying to start a 5.7L V8, that's kinda important.--Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand.  But their hardly weak, they'll clamp solid and stay put!(Update: If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these, Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $150.  I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good.)What I don't like:--Stiffness - They're not as flexible as I was hoping.  But about as flexible as I expected.  True welding cable in 2ga is about $3 per foot and per cable.  That's why the best jumper cables cost $200+.  Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty.--Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable doesn't go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws.  Instead.  It's screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body.  Still fine I'm sure.So why buy these cables aren't they overkill?  I've had this argument with people before: ""My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine.""  Well I will attempt to addess this.  As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases.  In other words 2ga has more (perhaps 50-100% more) conductor than 4ga.  This doesn't automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely.  For those that aren't aware (and I'm not an electrical engineer here), resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts.  Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together.  Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size.  Ambient temperature, conductor, line distance, voltage, and amperage.  Ambient temp we have no control over.  Hot is bad so just assume the worst.  This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing.  Conductor of these is copper so that's good.  You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor.  Distance and voltage.  One of these cable's strengths also happens to be a weakness.  Total run length for this circut is 50'.  Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop.  12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance.  So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this.  Amperage is also a big consideration.  The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate.  Basically on a small wire, a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen. 1) the wire will melt and/or catch on fire.  2) The load your trying to power won't work.  And make no mistake, starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy!  So bringing it all together.  Large load, low voltage (that we don't want to make in lower), and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find.  Addressing the orignal question and statment.  6' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine.  But if you want or need the extra length, you need to consider heavy gauge cables.  That said I've personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you?  So these will run you close to $100 shipped...do you actaully need them?  I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25' booster cables.  Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this.  The 4ga will do you fine at the 25' length for engines up to 5-liters or so (and honestly probably up to about 6L as well.)  Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment.  Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected.  Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag.  I have the Arsenal #5888 cable organizer and it works great for this.

I originally bought this for use with my kayaks which are 14' long to carry them in the back of the truck with its 6.5' bed. Instead I have been using this extender at least 3 times a month to transport long items.The two pieces fit one inside the other and the overall length is short enough that I can store it behind the seat of the truck until needed. The tubing is heavy enough gauge to support the rated load with no flexing. The two pins needed to attach it to a hitch receiver and to connect the two pieces are provided. The cross bar as multiple holes so I could adjust it for the height of the bed of my truck.There are end loops to use to tie a load and secure it to the bar. The center post also works well as an attachment point for lumber and pipe.I saw similar racks selling for more than twice as much that provided often less strength and no more versatility than this one.

33,A1CIBI697YK58A,B00008RW9U,"Have used a California Duster for over 15 years on brand new and old car finishes, from black to white. This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness.

But my paintless dent removal guy uses one and highly recommended the California Duster to me. He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed. And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on. He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it.I use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover. If you have a garage, it's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night, even garaged. You won't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster. And dust won't build up if you use it often enough.Before discovering the California Duster, I found that after washing my car, I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over. Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer, which in turn means I don't have to wash the car nearly as often.I got the plastic handle California Duster which was significantly cheaper at the time I ordered. Although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer, the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy, for the value oriented, get the plastic handle one since it's the exact same brush anyway!I am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle.

47,A2XXRN2ANQDBKO,B00008RW9V,"I've used a California Duster in the past with other vehicles and loved how it sucked up dust and dirt and held without scratching my finish.  I had gotten away from super-anal car care the last few years but with a recent purchase of a brand new 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek, my Automotive wishlist her on Amazon has been growing and another California Duster has been towards the top of the &#34;Really Want&#34; list.I still have my old Original California Duster and it works great (like fine wine, it got better with age) but was mostly interested in this smaller one for the interior.  I have a dark grey/charcoal colored interior that is patterned and almost feels 'sticky' to the touch for lack of a water word.  Using a microfiber cloth didn't really clean up the dust too well and another duster I picked up here works ok on the radio console and steering wheel but not on the dash itself.Despite a few negative reviews here I decided to give it a go after a recent price drop.  Picked this up for $4.63 when I figured I didn't have much to lose.Put it out on the porch for two days on a stack of newspapers as was suggested.  After that I gave it a bunch of really good shakes and then ran my fingers thru the fibers a few times trying to get out any of the lose ones.  That seemed to do the trick because I haven't had any issues with stray red fibers all over the place or the pad falling apart as I've read in previous reviews.Shortly after I went out to the car and cleaned the outside and the inside.  Shook it out a bunch and it seemed to work great on the dash which has been a PITA since I bought the car.  Afterwards I brought it inside and used it to dust my entire first floor of my house.  This included behind my tv and entertainment center, on top of my refrigerator and all those other places normally buried in dust.  Worked like a charm, sucked it all up and didn't let go.So I'd have to say this, just like it big brother, the Original, works like a charm.

89,A2JNI9V0X3YHK,B0000AXNMO,"This was recommended to us as a way to ease keeping our windshield clean when pulling a trailer. However, on first use it did a lot more for us than expected. The first time it rained after I used RainX was on a cross-country trip last week, and amazingly it almost completely eliminated the need to use windshield wipes even during downpours. Water drops still land on the windshield, but immediately rolls off whenever the car is moving, leaving a very clear view through the windshield - much clearer than even with wipers on high. For those who have flown small planes, the effect is much the same, and why such planes don't even have wipers. (At air speeds, wind pushes raindrops off the windshield very nicely all by itself.)The only time we needed to use the wipers in several days of rain and snow driving was when passing trucks, as those covered the windshield with clouds of tiny droplets that were hard to see through.A week later, I'm noticing the windshield no longer clears itself at speeds under 40 MPH, so it may be due for another treatment, but still stays nicely clear at highway speeds, and is very easy to clear at lower speeds with a single pass of the wipers.",Auto,2013-11-29,5,positive,recommended us way ease keeping windshield clean pulling trailer however first lot us expected first time rained rainx crosscountry trip last week amazingly almost completely eliminated need windshield wipes even downpours water drops still land windshield but immediately rolls whenever car moving leaving clear view windshield much clearer even wipers high flown small planes effect much planes dont even wipers air speeds wind pushes raindrops windshield nicely itselfthe time needed wipers several days rain snow driving passing trucks covered windshield clouds tiny droplets hard see througha week later im noticing windshield no longer clears speeds mph may due another treatment but still stays nicely clear highway speeds easy clear lower speeds single pass wipers,0.11917748917748919,positive,9.0,positive,positive

I spent a hoop of time looking on line for a quality product.  This one was well reviewed on many forums and after going to the factory web page I was convinced.  Amazon had the BEST price period.

I routed and zip-tied it to blend in with all of the other factory wires and ran it to the front lower valance [bumper] where I fabricated a simple aluminum bracket with grommet pull-through opening and terminated at a plug.  Now to use all I have to do is plug it in, no need to even open the hood.  With it disconnected you can barely see the plug from behind the license plate.  Total time about an hour and a half, if you are less particular I guess you could toss it in and be up and running in 10 minutes.  So far very happy, I have taken some measurements of the capabilities and thay are as claimed.

167,A1R3T01MVZU6Z5,B0000AY3X0,"The Absorber is made of polyvinyl alcohol which allows it to be super absorbent and reusable.  It comes in a plastic tube which serves as a holder for the Absorber and I would suggest you store it in there since the Absorber should be stored moist so it does not break down and stiffen.  The product really does absorb a lot of water and is the best car dryer I have ever had.  After you wash the car run the Absorber over the car and 90% of the water gets removed.  When the towel gets saturated, just wring it out and start drying again.  It cuts car drying time at least in half, maybe more, plus the effort to dry with this towel is less than with a standard towel or chamois.  If the car is in the sun or if you have hard water or if you are meticulous about your car, it may be a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the car after you use the Absorber to get the rest of the water off and to ensure no spots/streaks get  left behind.  When you are done, just wring most of the water out of the Absorber and roll it back into its plastic container for next time.  This is a great product for car drying or for cleaning up wet spills.  I highly recommended it for those purposes.

171,A24RT6AVJXJZHF,B0000AY3X0,"My wife was extremely pleased to find that this item is Made in Japan--both because she takes it as a sign of quality and because she's Made in Japan herself.We're also familiar with this kind of product in Japan, where it's called a ""gum towel.""I bought two actually, one for her and one for me to use on my bicycles--thinking it would be something like a super absorbant chamois rather than a gum towel.  It's certainly super absorbant, but doesn't have the chamois quality I would need to, say, polish my bike frames.  That is to say it's more sticky than soft, more like a piece of foam rubber or neoprene than a cloth.So if I just hosed down the bike while cleaning and wanted to get on with the next steps of polishing and relubing, this towel is a great way to dry the bike when it's neither hot nor dry enough of a day for the bike to dry out on it's own in a fair amount of time.It really draws the water out too, from every knook and cranny, so no need to use DW-40 before lubing my nice clean parts.My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that can't go in the dryer.  If you wash a sweater for example, it's best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry, as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.We use my far more grungy one as you might use a wet vac.  It actually does a better job than a wet vac though.Add that I've used several gum towels in Japan, mostly for swimming, and this is by far the thickest one I've used--therefore more absorbant.  And at 27"" x 17"" it's big enough to be used as a bath towel without having to ring it out over and over again.BOTTOM LINE:I recommend this particular make and model over others simply based on the large size and the thickness of the towel.Don't expect to use this to polish or dust, as the texture of the towel is far too sticky for that.I initially searched for the Sham-Wow on Amazon because I had seen it on TV, and still would like to try it out because it seems like it might be more chamois like--where you could wipe and polish with it.Overall, we're thrilled with the quality, size, and how well this item works.

179,AUJ0EKMC62HLC,B0000AY3X0,"Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car). This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed.",Auto,2011-10-08,5,positive,works great drying car quickly easily not hot enough quickly dont wan na polish water spots afterwords black car thing absorbs much water wont believe till takes beating keeps going first afraid gon na rip twisting water hard nope keep wringing dry continue ona little secret using least ive found work better way drying car lay absorber flat unfold across surface grasp one end corner drag slowly across car allowing absorb water comes contact works especially well horizontal surfaces but still good enough vertical ones well practice also helps prevent scratching surface small particles get trapped chamois paint surface hand comes pushes right paintlittle warning comes dont smell mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd but rinsed smell went away yes true put right back tube wet well get back tube must cant roll dry but leave top tube allow air dry close musty gross smell comes backlong story short get wont disappointed,0.00025510204081632563,negative,0.0,negative,positive
180,A1RGF9EVE67HG1,B0000AY3X0,"I've been using these things for several years and I buy a new one about every year or so. The Absorber is PVA, so it needs to stay a little wet because it gets very stiff when dry. Once you get used to it and how it works, it's great. There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper, but believe me, this one is superior in thickness and quality. I bought a cheap, generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you'd use a normal towel for. It won't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with, but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest. The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge, depending on how wet it is. It's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat. When it gets too wet, you just wring it out. When it gets a little dirty, soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer (just make sure you don't put it in the dryer, it comes out of the washer slightly damp, just like it should be stored).

But you need to change up rags often because it cakes and smears if you dont.I read reviews on Amazon which enticed me to give it a try. One said dont let dry any longer then 3 min and bottle claims same ( This is very true I am so pleased at results.The biggest improvment was the nice gold painted bottom of the Motorhome where the paint looked good before but now the paint looks glazed, shiny, and rich like I never was able to get this high a shine before.

291,A3963R7EPE3A7E,B0001L0DFA,"This nozzle is exactly as describe in write ups.  It has a variety of water patterns from full soaking to hard steady stream.  You can expect water to come out of the hose a full throttle unless you reduce it manually.  My first attempt to use it was with a small diameter hose and they are not the best to use for a nozzle that uses a standard hose.  The small diameter would not permit pressure buildup inside the hose and therefore the exit of water was at a much smaller volume than a standard hose.  No big thing.  Then I used the standard hose and the nozzle would at best take the stream over the second story of the house with no problems.  While the stream was not a great as I would like it at least got there thusly making this nozzle super for getting at the upper windows.  Next, I placed the nozzle on the front of a hose end sprayer to test its ability to handle liquid weeder, fertilizer or detergent.  It did far better than the nozzle that comes with the hose end sprayer.  Old happy gardener.  When comparing the price of the unit to other available sprayers of similar quality I would have to go with some of the cheaper ones that are made of metal and not plastic.  Some, however, plastic sprayers are not all that bad and one heckuva lot cheaper than the almost $25 for this nozzle.  While it is not perfect, it does the job for what I specifically want to use it for.  Also, I used it on the truck to clean it and it did a decent job except in an effort to preserve water it is something of a pain to have to screw the nozzle each time you want to cut the water off.

306,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0001L0DFA,"The sky high ratings intrigued me, so when the Bon-Aire ""ultimate"" nozzle was available as a Lightning Deal, I bought one to see if it lived up to the hype.The product appears to be very well constructed, and is quite a bit larger and heavier, than your typical cheapo nozzle.  You adjust the flow of water by turning the spray head at the front.  Water flow can be cut off at either end of the range, as the flow pattern goes from off, to a gentle sprinkle, to wide spray, and then narrowing into a beam, and then off again.  Because of the larger sized head, the ""ultimate"" nozzle has a larger area of coverage, and can deliver a larger volume of water.The nozzle does a decent job of diffusing water flow, producing a nice gentle flowing fountain of water suitable for watering potted plants or delicate flowers.  When adjusted more to a spray, it is well suited for vegetable gardens and general use.  This is however, nothing unique as far as sprinkler nozzles go.Fully open, the front aperture is about 0.12 inches in diameter, which produces a thicker stream of water than your typical cheapo nozzle.  Sometimes a thick stream is advantageous, but you will be using more water, and the increased water pressure may stress your plumbing.  Unless your system has high volume, and good water pressure, you may not be able to take full advantage this nozzle.The nozzle appears to be solidly built, and seems to work as advertised.  Unfortunately the aluminum parts on mine have a reddish finish, rather than green, which looks cooler.  Although it can deliver a higher volume of water, the assertion that it is the ""ultimate"" is perhaps an overstatement.  It does a good job, but not that much better than the various cheapo nozzles and spray guns.

317,A1VGXHHR08G044,B00020CAUG,"I avoided dynamat for the longest time because it's pricey for the coverage area.  However after researching this, it's not easy to find a comparable material.  I covered the interior walls of my dryer (I posted a photo above) and it reduced the low rumbling noise considerably.  Dynamat Xtreme is a butyl rubber compound covered by aluminum foil.  The butyl is viscoelastic - it has just the right consistency between solid and liquid to provide maximum sound damping.  The foil probably provides some level of fire resistance, since it is hard for a fire to develop without oxygen when it is sandwiched in between the metal layer.  Cheap alternatives that some people use include the asphalt based rolls of roof sealer.  However that stuff will smell bad when it heats up (whereas butyl doesn't have such odor) and it doesn't have an aluminum layer so it's more dangerous if it were to catch fire, and asphalt can ooze into a liquid.  The closest thing I have come across that resembles Dynamat Xtreme is Hard Cast Foil Grip 1402, a specialty tape sold to contractors for HVAC duct sealing.  This HVAC tape, a favorite of mine for all kind of sealing uses, is much thinner though.  It's also a butyl compound with a foil layer and is also very expensive.  Overall I haven't found any hardware store generic material that is as good as Dynamat Xtreme for sound damping on large panels.  The price here is pretty good - I called around to some local retailers and they wanted almost twice as much for this kit.",Auto,2011-03-20,5,positive,avoided dynamat longest time pricey coverage area however researching not easy find comparable material covered interior walls dryer posted photo reduced low rumbling noise considerably dynamat xtreme butyl rubber compound covered aluminum foil butyl viscoelastic right consistency solid liquid provide maximum sound damping foil probably provides level fire resistance since hard fire develop without oxygen sandwiched metal layer cheap alternatives people include asphalt based rolls roof sealer however stuff smell bad heats whereas butyl doesnt odor doesnt aluminum layer dangerous catch fire asphalt ooze liquid closest thing come across resembles dynamat xtreme hard cast foil grip specialty tape sold contractors hvac duct sealing hvac tape favorite mine kind sealing uses much thinner though also butyl compound foil layer also expensive overall havent found hardware store generic material good dynamat xtreme sound damping large panels price pretty good called around local retailers wanted almost twice much kit,0.0979166666666667,negative,0.0,negative,negative

341,A1M0M3TOS6CD1A,B00020CB2S,"I did quite a bit of research before deciding on Dynamat.  There are some cheaper competitors that people swear are just as good and they may be, but I just don't trust them as much.  If you do your research you will even see that some people chose to use roofing material that you can buy at Home Depot.  Someone would have to be OUT OF THEIR MIND to put $20 worth of roofing tar into a $20,000+ vehicle.  The only negative thing people have to say about Dynamat is that it is priced high, but if you buy the bulk packs on Amazon you will save yourself a ton of money and is actually a pretty cost effective solution for DIY work.  I have looked around and Amazon has the best price anywhere.Main competitors and my impressions of them.  I have not purchased or used these product, but this is an idea of why I chose Dynamat over them.  I am not a car audio professional by any means.  This is the first time I used deadening on my car and I am writing this to help anyone else who is thinking of doing this.1) RAAMAudio RAAMmat + Ensolite Foam - Most cost effective &#34;legitimate&#34; option.2) Sound Deadener Showdown - &#34;CDL Tiles&#34; + Mass Loaded Vinyl.  SDS would be an interesting choice.  If you look through forums you will see some people who really like this stuff, but I found the website to be confusing and I could not truly make an informed decision one way or another.3)Fatmat:  Cheapest of all automotive dampeners, but one Google search of &#34;fatmat smell&#34; is all you need to know.  Some say it smells awful and some don't, but there is no chance I risk it.  This stuff is super cheap, does not deaden as well as competitors and stinks.  I would use home depot roofing material before this product.  Move on.And to the &#34;REAL&#34; competitor.4) Second Skin Audio- Damplifier Pro + Closed Cell Foam (CCF)-  Although I decided on dynamat, based on reviews and forum comments, I think that Second Skin Audios product line may in fact be superior to Dynamat, but I decided against it for a few reasons.  Damplifier Pro is a good bit heavier than Dynamat extreme.  For most, this isnt going to make a huge difference, but I am lining a performance car with more emphasis on performance than sound.  I want an improved sound system, but if the increase in weight is only going to improve things very minimally it is just not worth it to me.  A lot of people say that Dynamat is the most expensive, but a 36 sq. foot pack of Damplifier pro costs $204+ shipping.  They do have some coupons occasionally, but it is more expensive.The fact is Dynamat is proven to work and is trusted by professionals.  I do not think you can go wrong with Dynamat because the only bad thing people have to say about it is that the price is high which is a bit of a myth.  If you drive a big truck or SUV, want the absolute best sound and aren't as concerned with weight, I would think about the 80sq foot Damplifier Pro shop pack and CCF foam.I turned my trunk into a enclosure with Dynamat Xtreme.  I lined just about every surface, doubling up in a few critical areas and was able to line my trunk with this kit.  If you want to really go out and line an entire car, you will need 100 sq ft+ of this stuff.  If you are doing the trunk and doors like me, you'll need 50-80 sq feet depending on whether or not you plan to cover the entire door.  I would use the bulk kit for anything but the doors.  You can surely use the Dynamat in the bulk kit on the doors, but the door kit strips 12&#34; x 36&#34; and make for a cleaner install because they will run the full length of any door.  It would not be the end of the world to have extra, but I would try to make a good estimate of how much you will need so that you arent leftover with a whole box of this stuff.One final recommendation as I try to unload all of the information I have learned.  Dynamat claims that you do not need a heat gun to install Dynamat Extreme.  That may be true, but after using a heat gun to put the finishing touches on the trunk, I would have to strongly recommend using a heat gun for trouble areas and difficult corners.  I was able to put the Dynamat down so much flatter and nicer by heating it up a bit and rolling it down.  it especially helps to heat corners and tight spots where you cannot get the roller in, because it makes it easier to mash the Dynamat down with your fingers.  I am not going to use the heat gun on the doors however, as I believe that there are more heat sensitive components in there and do not want to chance it Dynamat claims it is not a necessity.I plan on using Dynaliner on top of the Dynamat in the doors (and trunk I think) as well as by itself in a few areas.  I really hope this helps someone.

Remember that the weight of the vehicle is divided up amongst the stands. With the exception of the very biggest configuration of the very biggest 1 ton diesel pickup available most big non-commerical trucks weigh less than 1 ton per corner so even if these stands can only manage a third of their rated weight they are still overkill for most trucks let alone cars.Basically the welds should be better but these things are still very strong and perfectly fine for normal passenger vehicles.,Auto,2014-05-07,4,positive,really double locking feature backup incase release lever got kicked something stands also pretty good lift range welds arent best others pointed but thats youre going get price point ill probably reweld point but still far exceed needsi bought ton stands im not certain theyre strong enough support tons tons course definitely strong enough support normal vehicle remember weight vehicle divided amongst stands exception biggest configuration biggest ton diesel pickup available big noncommerical trucks weigh less ton per corner even stands manage third rated weight still overkill trucks let alone carsbasically welds better but things still strong perfectly fine normal passenger vehicles,0.20964285714285716,positive,22.0,positive,positive

422,A29Y601HEWKCIA,B00029WRJQ,"I bought a pair of these to use while pulling a 17' Bowrider type boat behind a 2007 Ford Ranger.  With just the stock mirrors, any traffic directly behind the boat was absolutely invisible to me.  With the mirrors, that is no longer the case.I had two problems initially: one due to my own ineptness and the other due to being alone.  When I first got these out of the box and clipped them into the bottom of the door and the window groove, the horizontal bar was not horizontal at all.  Adjusting the straps straightened that out completely.  Also, the mirrors appeared to be fixed in position and any effort to move them seemed as if it might break them.  Well, there are three Phillips head screws that encircle the adjustment ball; loosen them and you can move the mirror any way you want.The major problem remains adjusting the passenger side mirror.  If I had somebody to move it for me, I could adjust it in just a minute while I sat in the driver's seat.  As it is, I had to get out, adjust the mirror, get back in, check the adjustment from the driver's seat and repeat ad nauseum until I finally got it right.  I don't fault the mirror for that.These mirrors come one to a box so you need to order two of them.

423,A39AD95B47OEYX,B00029WRJQ,"I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin.

566,A4WCZVA328QB4,B0002F9YHI,"I have just bought this product after using some of the cheaper ($6) leather conditioners for a while.  This one certainly seems to be the best at rejuvenating leather.  You can feel the waxy film on your fingers after applying it, which you don't notice with other conditioners, and shows it has somethign substantial in it.All my vehicles have had leather seats and after a few years they have all had dry, cracked creases.  I have just got a ""new"" used minivan with leather seats and I want to ensure they don't go the same way.  I have to admit I've neglected seats compared with the rest of the vehicle.I used this product on my 1998 pickup's tan-colored front seats which are creased and starting to crack in places.  They were pretty dirty and the only way I found to get the grime out was using a Magic Eraser and leather cleaning solution.  This is a pretty harsh technique, but effective, apart from in the deepest creases.  It did seem to take the shine off the leather, which was a worry.  Using the Lexol conditioner, letting it soak in for 15 mins and then buffing with a microfiber cloth, the sheen is back and the leather feels much more supple.  It will never return to its ""new"" state, but it should last a few more years with regular applications (not sure but maybe every 3-4 months?).  It takes some effort to get through the stickiness at the first buffing, but the surface quickly eases up and a nice sheen (not a false shine) appears.On my minivan, the leather came up like it was just new.  It smells good too!I bought this product at my local Advance Auto (sorry Amazon!) and would certainly suggest you pay the extra $3-4 over the other conditioners as it really seems to be properly designed to replace the oils in the leather, not just put a protectant shine on the surface.

576,A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,B0002F9YHI,"Updated January 20, 2013I use this product on my Flexsteel leather couch, a high-quality couch.  It's a super long couch because it is actually two loveseats assembled together.  Each loveseat has an arm, one left and the other right.  Putting them together makes it one giant piece.  It's a lot of leather and that's why I bought this large container.I found that I had to buff a LOT more than I expected.  It took days for the conditioner to completely sink in after application, but I applied a heck of a lot thinking I was saving time.  You should be aware that buffing will probably be required and it will take some time for the leather to absorb the conditioner.The result is remarkable.  The color of the leather seems more vibrant and it has a shine actually.  Ultimately, this is protective of the leather and will make it last a lot longer.  In the meantime, it makes the leather look richer.One thing you will have a lot of trouble figuring out based on looking at product information for a large piece of leather furniture is what type of product should be used on it.  If you have an expensive piece, most likely there won't be instructions for this.  That's because the manufacturer doesn't want to take chances by informing you which conditioner you may use.

619,A636SDCLXDASU,B0002F9YIC,"There are so numerous spray leather cleaner and conditioner out there and I was curious to see how different they are.Here are my findings:1. All 5 spray leather cleaner and conditioner are priced between $7-9 for a 16 FL ounce bottle. This one is actually 16.9 FL OZ and cheaper than some of the other brands, so a good value.2. This one has no particular scent, which I prefer.3. The bottle holds nicely in the hands, it's very ergonomically designed.4. The spray nozzle is the nicest and best (big, sturdy, fine mist) of all the spray bottles I have tried.5. Since this is a cleaner only, you should follow with a leather conditioner (also stated on the back of the bottle), which I find a bit of a hassle.

679,A1SW87O7XJI740,B0002JMIEK,"I torture-tested this product on a big black Lincoln Town Car Signature L that emerged from the winter with the old wax stripped off by time, weather and automatic car washes. This is a car I detail by hand during the warmer seasons, so I decided to try Liquid Glass when it came time to revitalize the finish.The most appealing characteristics of Liquid Glass are ease of use, lack of residue, durability, and its ability to repel water and road dirt. This is possibly the easiest product to remove that I have ever used. You can apply it to the entire car in just about any conditions and buff it off very easily, although you may have some white powder floating around if you apply it too heavily. It doesn't stain plastic or rubber parts, so you don't have to worry much about where you apply it. Liquid Glass repels water so well that I can just about dry the car completely with the exhaust from my shop vacuum, with just a little help from a microfiber cloth. Its water-repelling properties make it useful to apply to all the glass on the car as well as the painted parts.Starting with essentially bare paint, I didn't find that a single coat of Liquid Glass was enough to produce the results I wanted, but two applications did the trick. I also tried a third coat to see what would happen, but additional benefits weren't apparent. (Each coat was applied on a different day to allow the product time to cure.) Liquid Glass produced a good shine, but the results didn't surpass what I've achieved with other quality products. Since I didn't have time to do any polishing, I wondered whether Liquid Glass would have some cosmetic effect of filling in swirl marks, but it didn't seem to do as much as some other products in this respect. There also wasn't an exceptional depth to the shine it produced on a black car. My impression is that the Liquid Glass finish is hard and durable, but on the thin side. It does, however, produce a slick finish that repels water and road dirt very well, so that sometimes I only need to rinse the car with water and blow it dry instead of washing it.Liquid Glass is a good product in many respects, and I intend to get my money's worth from the can I bought. The jury is still out as to whether I'll buy more or try something else.UPDATE: The product I ultimately decided to stick with is Turtle Wax Ice Liquid Polish. It's a synthetic polish with all the benefits of Liquid Glass that I described above. However, it's even easier to use than Liquid Glass, more economical, and produces a better-looking result.

Not that long ago I threw out the mostly unused bottles of just about everything else and stocked up on a few more cans of liquid glass.  Every now and then I will test out the latest and greatest but I keep coming back.In terms of shine, durability and protection, I simply have found nothing better.  A few years ago I noticed a friend's car had a wet paint shine to it and that is when I discovered this product.  I have since achieved the same results on all of my own vehicles of varying age and color.  It is a shine and slickness that people ask about.Recently, the good workers of PennDot were directing traffic over a recently painted yellow line.  Later I discovered lots of dreaded yellow speckles all over the lower quarter.  Thanks to a couple coats of liquid glass protecting my paint, I was able to easily remove what could have been a disaster.Sure, some of the pure caranuba waxes are nice, so long as you hardly ever take your garage queen further than the enclosed trailer.

700,A1RZ7SJFTNNWI6,B0002JMIEK,"Update on November 1st,2012: I am on my third bottle of Liquid Glass LG-100 & there is no going back to anything else for me at this point.  I even use this stuff on my windshield, it last longer than Rain-X while providing much better gliding action, rain just glide over the windshield. It's a nice feeling not having to use wipers.It's hard to write another review for an outstanding product with numerous positive feedbacks under its belt. But unlike most people I used Liquid Glass with a different approach. I used my Liquid Glass in conjunction with Blue Magic's TR3 which in my opinion is slightly more abrasive, which makes it a better scratch remover & a better glazing compound than the Liquid Glass which is a better paint sealer and/or protector.My entire detail process took 2 days. Day 1 was washing & claying followed by a thorough polishing job with Blue Magic's TR3. After the required 2 hrs cure for the TR3, Liquid Glass is applied with an orbital buffer that has Mequiar's W8006 polishing pad attached to it.Follow instructions & let the Liquid Glass ""bake"" in the sun with ambient temp above 70 degrees for a minimum 4 hrs.  I applied a second coat on Day 2 once the ambient reaches above 70, again let it bake for 4 hrs before applying 3rd coat.The end result is complete paint restoration that looks like no other wax job unlike anything I have ever seen. My 97 Chevy Dually now looks like a new truck with a brand new layer of clear coat paint over its once dull, faded paint.For as long as you are willing to invest the time by applying multiple coats & baking it for 4 hrs in between, you will never look back at ""any"" wax, paint sealer or polish etc out there.

704,A2HRHF83I3NDGT,B0002JMIEK,"I am not a detailing professional but I do like keeping my cars looking new. I have bought 2 brand new cars since 2009 and I have kept them looking new by buying all kinds of car caring products. I visit a lot of different car forums and collect the best car care products including cleaners, wax, tire shine etc. If you need advice on recommended tire shine, cleaners, car wash, write a comment. I have heard about liquid glass before but I wasn't convinced that it was as good as people say it is. I was tired of applying wax all the time and the results were great but it didn't last long. I bought my second car several months ago and I wanted to keep it looking new all the time without applying wax every week. I almost purchased OptiCoat 2.0 because many people say it is a permanent coat on top of your clear coat and it lasts well over 3 years. I decided not to buy it because I don't think my car will keep looking new for three years after applying a product one time. So I did some research on other products and I came across liquid glass again. This is a very old product that has been around for over 20 years but the formula has slightly changed over time. The ownership of the company has also changed but the product is better than ever.It's very simple to apply and keeps the car looking shiny and it is somewhat permanent. Since my car was new, I didn't use a clay bar to get all the materials off the paint. I simply used the liquid glass pre cleaner and then applied liquid glass polish. You have to make sure the paint is clean and defect free. If you have rock chips, I would recommend applying touch up paint first because the liquid glass will permanently seal those chips and will be hard to fill later. I applied one layer of liquid glass using a microfiber cloth one section at a time and let it dry for 15 minutes and then cleaned off the haze using another cloth. Make sure the temperature is at least 50 degrees and there is sunshine. After doing the entire car, let the car bake in the sun for about 4 hours and apply another coat and let that bake. After my second coat, my car looked better than new and I am not kidding. It is a white car and it had a deep shine to it. I can tell that there is a layer of protection on my car. It has been two months since I applied the two coats and to this day water just bounces off my car and dirt barely sticks to the paint. I also applied liquid glass to my mirrors and windows. It's funny to see the water sliding off my glass when it rains. It is very easy to wash my car now because the dirt does not stick to the car as strongly as it used to. Liquid glass can be applied many times as desired without removing the old coat; it is actually recommended that you apply multiple coats. The more coats you apply the deeper the shine gets. I have read in many places that after about 20 coats, the paint will have a lot more rock chip protection. The layer will get thick and will protect your original paint from chips. Obviously you can't expect total protection because rocks can fly at your car pretty fast.  I am waiting for better weather to apply more coats. I actually bought a gallon of liquid glass from autobarn.com for around $60. You should not apply any wax on top of liquid glass if you plan to apply more coats because you will have to remove that wax before applying another coat.",Auto,2014-02-19,5,positive,not detailing professional but keeping cars looking new bought brand new cars since kept looking new buying kinds car caring products visit lot different car forums collect best car care products including cleaners wax tire shine etc need advice recommended tire shine cleaners car wash write comment heard liquid glass but wasnt convinced good people say tired applying wax time results great but didnt last long bought second car several months ago wanted keep looking new time without applying wax every week almost purchased opticoat many people say permanent coat top clear coat lasts well years decided not dont think car keep looking new three years applying one time research products came across liquid glass old around years but formula slightly changed time ownership company also changed but better everits simple apply keeps car looking shiny somewhat permanent since car new didnt clay bar get materials paint simply liquid glass pre cleaner applied liquid glass polish make sure paint clean defect free rock chips would recommend applying touch paint first liquid glass permanently seal chips hard fill later applied one layer liquid glass using microfiber cloth one section time let dry minutes cleaned haze using another cloth make sure temperature least degrees sunshine entire car let car bake sun hours apply another coat let bake second coat car looked better new not kidding white car deep shine tell layer protection car two months since applied two coats day water bounces car dirt barely sticks paint also applied liquid glass mirrors windows funny see water sliding glass rains easy wash car dirt not stick car strongly liquid glass applied many times desired without removing old coat actually recommended apply multiple coats coats apply deeper shine gets read many places coats paint lot rock chip protection layer get thick protect original paint chips obviously cant expect total protection rocks fly car pretty fast waiting better weather apply coats actually bought gallon liquid glass autobarncom around not apply wax top liquid glass plan apply coats remove wax applying another coat,0.19117032392894462,positive,37.0,positive,positive

721,A1D9V4TAFTO6M2,B0002JN2EU,"I have a 1999 Mercedes-Benz C230 that had ~144,000 miles on it.  The idle was very rough and noisy, and the engine wasn't as smooth as it should have been in general, especially at lower engine speeds.  The problem was so bad that the engine would almost stall at idle after first being started.I tried Lucas ""Upper Cyclinder Lubricant and Injector Cleaner"", and it didn't seem to help at all.  Then I put a full 20-oz bottle of Chevron Techron through the fuel tank, and it also seemed to do nothing.  In each case, the product was used as directed, and the car was driven until the fuel level was very low.  That is, I didn't refill the fuel tank and dilute the product in either case.  In the past, I've also used other brands of fuel system and fuel injector cleaners, including Gumout and STP.  None of these products seemed to have the slightest effect.Finally, and extremely skeptical, I tried Sea Foam Motor Treatment.  I put a full 16-oz bottle in the fuel tank after filling up.  The improvement was dramatic and immediate.  The engine ran much more smoothly and quietly than before.  The engine no longer idled like a diesel farm tractor.  I was extremely surprised, but still skeptical, because I wasn't sure if it had actually cleaned anything, or if it was simply helping because it was being burned with the fuel.  So, I withheld judgment until the fuel tank had been driven to near-empty and refilled, meaning that the amount of Sea Foam left in the fuel would be negligible.This was no placebo effect.  Even after refueling, the car ran much better than it did before.  It now idles more nicely than my Hyundai, which still seems bizarre to me.  I am extremely pleased, which doesn't happen often, trust me.  I'll be putting a can of Sea Foam Motor Treatment through my fuel tanks before every oil change from now on.My other car, a Hyundai Sonata, had an annoying ticking sound when it would idle, especially when cold.  I would have described the sound as a ""lifter tick"", but I'm not sure what it was--a sticking valve?  I don't know; I'm no mechanic.  I added the recommended amount of Sea Foam to the crankcase, and the sound went away immediately, or nearly so.  I've since changed the oil in that car, and the sound has not returned.Some people criticize Sea Foam based on its age.  I find these criticisms ridiculous--as if ""older"" equates with ""worse"".  Do these people ever address the actual chemistry of the product, or provide actual reasons for their disapproval?  No, they just complain about how long it's been around.Sea Foam made me a believer.

724,A2V9ULRWMX9WEJ,B0002JN2EU,"I used this on my pickup truck because I had been getting some hard starts and rough idles and decreased fuel economy.  For about the past 6 months, I have noticed about a 2mpg drop in fuel economy.A couple of my friends have used this stuff and claimed success, so I gave it a shot.  I added a can to the fuel tank, and half a can each to the crankcase and air intake.  Let it sit and drove it around.  It smoked like crazy as promised.Now, anecdotally, I do think it smoothed out my idle and I haven't had a hard start.  But, there is nothing I can quantify, and I am not sure that the improvements are not all psychological.  I think my truck runs better if I wax it.  My use also coincided with the end of winter, so the operating temperatures can account for the improvements, too.  I did not see an improvement in mpg.So, if this is where my story ended, I'd say give it a go.  If it works, great.  If not, you didn't lose too much.BUT...The second tank after using this I got a o2 sensor code and had to replace a downstream sensor.  To be fair, the truck has 100k, and this could just be the natural lifespan of the sensor.  Since I had already noticed a drop in mpg, the sensor was likely on its way out.  At the same time, I think it is rather interesting that it failed less than 300 miles after using this product when I've been driving around with the diminished mpg for several thousand miles.

733,A2VZGCHG3KNJGV,B0002JN2EU,"I bought this under the guidance of my Smog Technician to clear up a high NOx rating for 15mph.I have a 1998 Honda Civic EX VTEC, 5 speed. The past 15 years, the car has always passed smog with flying colors (usually, all the numbers are 0 or close to it). This year, the car passed everything fine with the same record, except NOx at 15 mph. Reading online said that this is the place to fail if your car is going to fail. Prior years, the number was 50, with a max limit of 480 or so. This year, it went up to 780.So, I bought seafoam and, unlike a lot of other people, my car hardly smoked at all. I baby my car usually (short shift, cruise at 60-65, easy on the gas and brake and clutch) all in the name of gas mileage. With only an intake, exhaust, and headers, I average into the mid 40's for gas mileage average, when the EPA for the car is 25/33.I'm not sure if this is something to do with my car getting old and the Catylitic converter is getting bad, but after Seafoam, the car registered a barely pass of 460 out of 480 max.For those of you who wonder, I added the seafoam through the brake booster vacuum line. This, from what I have been told, is good for a quick fix and to pass smog. I later dumped the rest of the can (2/3 left) into the gas tank. Its hard to notice, but I believe the car idles a bit easier (no gushing kind of noises). Could be cleaning the injectors.Whatever the case, I passed smog and plan on using this the next time I go in for a smog 2 years from now.I read a lot of forums online and there is great debate over seafoam. It took me a while to buy it, but it worked. 5 Stars! Worst that happens is you put it into a car that is held together by carbon deposits and your car leaks. If you car leaks oil already, or you believe it has the possibility to with engine cleaning, don't buy this. But if you have high NOx or other figures, this is is a good buy to pass smog.

The engine on my Vino 125 scooter had been hard starting, and running rough- signs of a gummed up fuel system. I was hoping I could clean it out without having to disassemble everything to get at the carb, a major pain on the Vino. I added 2 ounces of Motor Tune to a full tank, and let the scooter run for an hour. And surprise, the engine smoothed out. No more coughing and sputtering. Started a lot easier after it cooled down, too.  I added the rest of the can of Motor Tune to the tank of my 2003 Honda Element, which, my mechanic tells me, could use a fuel injector cleaning. Might just save me a hundred bucks here.So what's in it? The MSDS (manufacturer's safety data sheet) says it's 40-60% ""pale oil,"" 25-35% Naptha, and 10-20% IPA. Naptha is a light hydrocarbon fraction, lighter than gasoline. Lighter fluid and Coleman Fuel are naptha. Pale oil is a very light, heavily refined, pale yellow oil- several sources tell me that kerosene is pale oil. And IPA is just isopropyl alcohol. Amazingly simple- you could make up your own mix, which I might just do next time. (One experimenter who did a lot of testing suggests four parts diesel fuel, 2 parts naphtha, and 1 part ""HEET""  brand IPA.) The IPA binds to any water in the tank or fuel line, I suspect the naptha dissolves varnish deposits, and the oil is a carrier, according to a mechanical engineer I spoke with.Incidentally, I found my can on sale at the local O'Reilly's for $4.99 for 16 ounces.

Once all used, TURN OFF CAR.  Let sit for at least 5 minutes(preferably 15) and then turn the car back on and DRIVE IT somewhere, aggressivelybut not irresponsibly.  Do so for 20 minutes or so or at least until the smoke dissipates.Most cars don't need this treatment but I can see it on an older car or a vehicle that'sbeen abused and requires a full tune-up.Be ever mindful that the deposits you liberate from the engine may, in fact, be all thatholds the motor together.  Oil might not lubricate as well (or at all) if the clearances betweenbearings are so wide (without the deposits in place) that it can't reach them.  Take care whenusing this product, and do so responsibly.Better idea: run 20% Marvel Mystery oil in your crankcase (use 1 of each 5 quarts as MMO), add 4 or 5ounces of it (per 10 gallons) to the fuel, and pour some down the carburetor (or into PCV valve or acarefully-selected vacuum line) ) once the car is started.  Don't go crazy with the amount you pour intothe engine directly.  Run it in a new oil change: use cheap (but new) oil.  Use a cheap (but decent)  oilfilter like a Fram ExtraGuard [the Orange Can].  Run for 2-4 weeks.  Change oil again with a good filter(Motorcraft are my favorites but Purolator and Mobil 1 are great as well) and decent oil (preferably synthetic)and watch the crap drain out with the oil/Marvel Mystery Oil combo.  Continue to run good oils and filtersfrom then on, and perhaps repeat this procedure every few years or as you believe it necessary.Seafoam is a far more aggressive crankcase cleaner (flush) solution which fewer cars are inbad enough condition to require.

I've used their leather cleaner, leather protectant, and 2-in-1 leather protectant with great success, so I had high expectations for the Vinylex.The best way to describe Vinylex is that it is almost like 303 Aerospace Protectant, which I have used for over 12 years with good success. Vinylex is a white milky liquid that is applied to plastic and rubber to protect it from UV radiation and degradation. It's not supposed to contain silicone which can dry out dash board materials.I've used the Vinylex on polycarbonate, plastic car trim, dashboards, steering wheels, center consoles, and the plastic body panels on my Ducati Monster 696. It dries cleanly leaving no greasy residue or smell. There are no streaks either. However, I don't recommend using it directly on the grip area of a steering wheel or any other surface where friction is required for safety purposes. It does get somewhat slippery even when dry.The directions indicate to shake well, so there's probably some ingredients that settle. However, I recommend covering the nozzle with a cloth when you shake it because some product does come out. I just use old (but clean) cotton socks for applying the Vinylex. The best part about Vinylex is that there seems to be no off-gassing after applying it on the dashboard. When I tried Armor All products and even 303, it tended to leave a filmy residue on the inside of the windshield as it dried out. The 303 also had an odd smell, whereas Vinylex is almost totally odor-free. I also used Vinylex on the EPDM rubber door seals on my cars.Overall: 5/5 stars, highly recommended.

776,A3H20ZQC0D6F74,B0002KKHS8,"I decided to give this stuff a try after watching a video featuring a professional detailer. He suggested to use this stuff and to NEVER use anything by Armor All because the greasy film produces a greenhouse effect, trapping all the rays the sun puts out and basically cooks the plastic, causing premature aging, cracking, etc.. I foolishly started using Armor All about 3 years ago because it made the plastic in my car look really nice and had a deep, rich black color it was starting to lack. But then I gave Vinylex a try and once I removed the Armor All that was previously applied, I noticed that my circular air vents actually turned a little white. I can only assume the AA caused that. So I stripped all my interior plastic of the AA and used Vinylex and, depending on how much you apply, leaves a really nice matte finish with a slight bit of sheen, but with no glare in the windshield. The AA wipes I used, even if I wrung them out, still left a highly reflective shine on the dash.The best way I found to apply Vinylex is to take a good quality microfiber towel, fold it and then spray about 3 good squirts, rub it in and that should cover a whole door panel with ease. Then switch to a clean side of that microfiber and kinda wipe off or buff some of the wetness you may get on the plastic. Also use it on interior weather stripping where the doors shut-- mine were looking spotty with water and almost chalky, simply because I never bothered to clean them. The Vinylex made them look dark black and brand new. I have access to this stuff because the Toyota dealer I work at sells it and a lot of it. I've honestly never seen it anywhere else.

U am here to say otherwise.The first is someone stated they are having issues with this sealant causing swirls. No liquid, in any way, will ever put swirls in a car. The one product that wi is the applicator you are using to apply the product. Always make sure you have a good microfiber or foam applicator.Second, and the one people have the most difficulty with, is how hard it is to wipe this off. This is a wipe on wipe off product that applies very very thinly to your car. The proper application is to dampen your applicator with water, put some klasse in a small spray bottle and spritz it on the applicator. Then apply to a small section and immediately wipe off. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove.This stuff is meant to last and it does. Traditional waxes would have to be applied on the entire car and then you would wait and then wipe off. This is a sealant, it requires little time to cure or adhere to your paint.I use this and a 33oz bottle I figure will last me at least 5 years, applying one coat twice a year on a mid size sedan.Klasse is very slick. After a rainfall, the only thing that is wet afterwards is the trunk and center of the roof, as those are the only flat parts.It also gives off a great shine and lasts me 6 months with washing twice a week.If there are some spots you missed and the product has dried on or is too hard to remove, simply apply more and rub off.",Auto,2013-01-14,5,positive,im writing review read negatives peoole u say otherwisethe first someone stated issues sealant causing swirls no liquid way ever put swirls car one wi applicator using apply always make sure good microfiber foam applicatorsecond one people difficulty hard wipe wipe wipe applies thinly car proper application dampen applicator water put klasse small spray bottle spritz applicator apply small section immediately wipe longer wait harder removethis stuff meant last traditional waxes would applied entire car would wait wipe sealant requires little time cure adhere painti 33oz bottle figure last least years applying one coat twice year mid size sedanklasse slick rainfall thing wet afterwards trunk center roof flat partsit also gives great shine lasts months washing twice weekif spots missed dried hard remove simply apply rub,-0.02065972222222223,negative,3.0,positive,positive

When you are ready for it to shine, get this product out.Get yourself a velcro &#34;pad holder&#34; that fits in your palm.  Attached a round 4&#34; pad to the velcro holder.  Apply just 1-3 drops from the jug on the pad.  That is all.  Then do about a 2' x 2' section.  Put it on very lightly.  Oh... DO IT IN THE SHADE!!  This product dries as hard as a rock.  If you put it on heavy, you may get frustrated.  But there is no need.Do one fender at a time.  Put on very lightly.  Wipe off before going to next fender/door whatever.  Just 3 drops will do a whole door.  This product goes a long way.  You have a tendency to put it on heavy to start because you want to &#34;see a haze&#34; to wipe off.  You don't need a heavy haze.  Just a light one.  Then BUFF with a soft double folded cloth.  If you put it on LIGHTLY, it will only take light buffing.  If you mistakenly put it on heavy, you may have a tendency to RUB IT HARDER --- BUT THAT CAUSES SWIRL MARKS from even a soft towel thread.  So If you put it on heavy,let it dry.  Then overspray with a little Quick Detailer spray (any brand you prefer) and then wipe.  The heavy haze comes off.  You can also spray the Quick Detailer on a rag first and then wipe off the haze.  That little bit of moisture prevents you from &#34;muscling&#34; out the haze.RESULTS:  Amazing GLASS LIKE seal over your car like you have never seen!  And, it almost appears as if you had it sprayed with a gloss clear coat.  And, it is a HARD finish.  GLOSSY.  And, it has lasted through 3 months of car washes and dusty roads.

853,A1EE4PMEYPD796,B0002MA03S,"Yes these horns, and any other Hella Supertone horns you find ""new"" will be made in China. I was slightly worried when I first ordered because I did my research and knew this was the case. I ordered anyways because of the lack of reviews on other types of horns out there. I put these on the front of my Hyundai Elantra and completely removed the stock horn.Keep in mind that the only thing that comes in the box is a pair of horns (high tone and low tone) and a relay. USE THE RELAY. You might think that the power going to the stock horn is sufficient but run a volt meter to it, when the horn is pressed, and chances are you are getting less than 12V. Just as you would think the extra power just creates a louder horn.I got all of my supplies from Home Depot. A 36x1"" bar of steel and 2 nuts and bolts. I cut this down and drilled two holes to mount my horns to because I didn't have room in the stock location. I also got a spool of red wire and a spool of black wire 14 gauge (a little oversized, you'd be fine with 16 or 18), some heat shrink, and connectors to plug into the horn, relay, and attach to the battery and grounding points. I took my time and made sure that all of my connections were crimped, soldered, and shrinked very well.

873,A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,B0002MB80C,"Great cover! I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little, and it is not moving; low 80's outside today but likely over 110F in the car. I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4's is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15"" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.In 'the old days' I bought wrapped 'stinky' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this 'new and improved' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also.

875,A2C3BWJJ4TT7FY,B0002MB80C,"Like others I have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department. I understand it's leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product, sizing is critical because unlike vinyl, leather can't be stretched too much for a fit. This limits you to a steering wheel that is within 5mm of the product's diameter. I have tried fitting this on two steering wheels. First on my F250 and it was literally impossible. The diameter of the cover missed it by inches. Then I tried fitting this on my Saturn Vue. Now this is important, because the Vue is geared towards women whom have small hands, ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier. So you would think the Vue is a perfect candidate...NOPE. I wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear. After 10mins (not including breaks) I finally got the thing on the Vue. The result was the leather had stretched so much, it literally developed permanent stretch marks. Also, like other's who have commented in their Feedback, the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel. So there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel.I gave it a rating of three due to it's exceptional quality. It is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched. If this was right-size for my application it would have rated it Five.Part of the poor fit was my fault since I didn't pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering I should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit. I mistakenly assumed since I had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny, that It wouldn't have been a problem fitting.Take proper care with the dimensions of 15 x 1.5  Measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape. If 1.5"" does not cover at least 70% of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel's diameter is great than 15 inches, you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install.",Auto,2012-08-14,3,positive,others found cover fall short sizing department understand leather unlike comparable vinyl based sizing critical unlike vinyl leather cant stretched much fit limits steering wheel within 5mm products diameter tried fitting two steering wheels first f250 literally impossible diameter cover missed inches tried fitting saturn vue important vue geared towards women small hands ergo steering wheel smaller skinnier would think vue perfect candidatenope wrestled installation would described sparring bear 10mins not including breaks finally got thing vue result leather stretched much literally developed permanent stretch marks also others commented feedback wrap made barely halfway around grip wheel two pressure points hands front back seams wrap gripping wheeli gave rating three due exceptional quality well made sense leather thick seams well stitched rightsize application would rated fivepart poor fit fault since didnt pay close enough attention specs prior ordering measured steering wheels proper fit mistakenly assumed since two steering wheels one especially skinny wouldnt problem fittingtake proper care dimensions x measure girth steering wheel seamstress measuring tape not cover least steering wheel circumference wheels diameter great inches immensely disappointed least frustrated install,0.06500000000000002,negative,4.0,positive,negative

It is  gentle, effective and provides the best shine possible, whether your car is nearly new or has 100,000 miles on it.My daily driver is an original owner, 18 year old, bright red M3, and it still turns heads because it still looks great - thanks in part to regular use of 3M hand glaze.  Here's what you do - wash your car well, using one of the better car wash solutions like Meguiar's hi-tech wash or P21S car shampoo.  Dry.  Then use Griot's Garage (or similar) paint cleaning clay to remove surface contaminants and start to work on the swirls and other imperfections in your paint.  (You can skip this step, but I've recently discovered this cleaning clay and it really does wonders, especially on cars that spend a lot of time in the woods where birds, bugs and tree sap are unavoidable).Now - get out the 3M Imperial hand glaze.  This stuff is very finely abrasive and supremely gentle on your paint - clear coat or not. Use a terry or foam applicator pad to rub the glaze into the paint and rub out fine swirls and scratches.  Work on a small section of the car at a time -- perhaps a square foot or so of surface. Always buff the glaze off, before it dries, with a best quality cotton or microfiber polishing cloth.When you're done with the 3M hand glazing process, your paint will be at its best - silky smooth and contaminant free.  It will shine as best as it knows how - but you're not finished.  This is a polish, not a protectant wax.  So now's the time to protect the paint with a high quality wax - I recommend P21S carnauba or one of the Zymol paste waxes.Follow this regimen, do it two or three times a year and keep your car washed in between. If you care about how your car looks, then year after year, you will be glad you did.",Auto,2012-12-30,5,positive,youre one folk likes keep car looking clean shiny whatever weather no matter old car might stuff want hand gentle effective provides best shine possible whether car nearly new miles itmy daily driver original owner year old bright red m3 still turns heads still looks great thanks part regular 3m hand glaze heres wash car well using one better car wash solutions meguiars hitech wash p21s car shampoo dry griots garage similar paint cleaning clay remove surface contaminants start work swirls imperfections paint skip step but ive recently discovered cleaning clay really wonders especially cars spend lot time woods birds bugs tree sap unavoidablenow get 3m imperial hand glaze stuff finely abrasive supremely gentle paint clear coat not terry foam applicator pad rub glaze paint rub fine swirls scratches work small section car time perhaps square foot surface always buff glaze dries best quality cotton microfiber polishing clothwhen youre done 3m hand glazing process paint best silky smooth contaminant free shine best knows but youre not finished polish not protectant wax nows time protect paint high quality wax recommend p21s carnauba one zymol paste waxesfollow regimen two three times year keep car washed care car looks year year glad,0.31983930211202943,positive,40.0,positive,positive

It was also a heavy duty, industrial gun like this Lincoln. I like heavy duty, but there is a limit to how much force needs to be applied to free the coupler from the grease fitting. Most do-it-yourselfers have a Dremel. Dremel makes a small, cone-shaped, red-stone bit. It's head is 5mm wide at the base and 8.5 long. I don't know the item number. It is tiny. Under a magnified florescent work lamp, I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped, spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting, careful to maintain the original contour. This took about two minutes. I'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection. I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear. This grease gun is top quality. After a two-minute modification, it is now a customized tool. Guys like to customized cars, motorcycles and guns, why not their tools?

It works ideally on older, imperfect finishes.I have a 12 year old car which I used to be very avid about keeping cleaned, vacuumed, and waxed.

Being outside all the time has slowly worn away the clear coat on the car, so the finish oxidizes fairly easily now.

1044,A6TW412I6RWID,B0002SQVX0,"Since my car is only 2 years old, I chose this Meguiar's #9 Swirl remover as I didn't want to have anything too aggressive. The paint was not in too bad a shape as I always used the 2 bucket hand wash method. Just light swirling on my grabber blue paint. To prepare the surface I washed the car then used Meguiar's clay bar to remove any embedded matter in the paint. Surprising what is in there after only 2 years even though the paint looked clean to the naked eye. After the claying I got out the Porter Cable polisher. Since this is an orbital polisher it is good for anyone who is new to using a power tool on your paint. This was my first time. It was quite simple actually. I mentally divided the hood into 5 section and did one at a time putting an X pattern on the Meguiar's polishing pad with the #9 Swirl remover. I did 4 section passes on each area and then used a microfiber towel to take off the excess polish. I could immediately see that the pad I used (Meguiar's 6.5-Inch Soft Buff Foam Polishing Pad) was just enough to do an excellent job. You see, since the paint was only 2 years old I didn't need a too aggressive polish, or a pad that cut too much. So if your car is in similar condition this may be a good combination for you. This I guess is why you do a test are first and not the whole car. After I was satisfied that this was the right combination, I moved on and finished the car. If it did not do the trick, I could use more pressure, a more aggressive pad, ramp up the speed on the polisher (I used setting 5 for this) or maybe bought a more aggressive polish. I really liked this stuff. Quite easy to do and I wasn't afraid that the polish would burn through my clear coat. I finished it up with Meguiar's liquid Ultimate Wax.

1053,A35W3JQYP0M655,B0002SQYSM,"I was first introduced to a mechanics stethoscope quite a few years ago when I used to use a regular physicians stethoscope I had picked up somewhere when needed for car repairs.  I located a mechanics model in a catalog and ordered it there.  I found it to be far more versatile with its long stem conductor instead of the flat plastic head on a physicians model, as well as much easier to use by design.  About a year ago my old stethoscope got run over during one of my more intense repairs, and I have since picked up this very same Lisle model from a local parts store.  The price here on Amazon for this 52500 model is cheaper than what I paid, and at the time of this writing ships free when bundled.  Although there are more expensive models available on Amazon, I cannot imagine anyone needing anything more than what this one offers.  Its solid, durable, and very comfortable to wear.I should point out that a mechanics stethoscope is one of the most versatile tools you can own. Even if you never do any work on cars.  You would not believe the number of uses one finds for this instrument when you have one around. Ever have one of those annoying squeaks or rattles inside your car, or some other place that you can't exactly pin down no matter how close you seem to get to it?  With this baby you will find ground zero on the squeak in a couple of minutes.  In addition to cars, you can easily locate squeaks or noises in any kind of machinery, or in your homes floor and walls. I even used mine to locate an irritating squeak on a neighbors sewing machine.  It is very easy to use, and even a lot of fun at times.As for this model versus a higher priced one, unless you're a highly paid specialist of some kind that prefers the very best, I would pass up the more expensive scopes available here or anywhere else and buy this one.  It is all the scope most of us should ever need, and one of the most handy and versatile tools to have in your home or garage.....

Hell I can even hear my own vein/artery pulse (very low) with it. The overall build quality is flimsy (bad), so that was a bit disappointing. The long probe tip shown in the picture is very fragile (easy to bend), so be careful. While I cannot compare it with any other, I can say it should come in handy in the future, just keep it in a padded sturdy case of some sort, and you may have to disassemble it prior to storing it, since it is fairly long - about 16"" with the least bend radius allowable. The ear buds are a bit tight, it hurts my ears to use it after a short while. Again, it is extremely sensitive to sounds, even touching any part of it produces a lot of sounds, so keep that in mind when you use it.

1067,A2EHYCA29NSQLU,B0002SQYV4,"I'm bucking the trend of favorable reviews here.I do give it two stars because it does go on easy, smells decent, and has excellent cleaning capability.  The towel came out more black than with other products, which I assume indicates it is removing a lot of oxidized black rubber/trim.Unfortunately, this product does NOT last.  I covered all the rubber/plastic on my car (two thorough coats), let it soak in/settle for a day, then washed it to get the overwipe/streaks of nearby body panels, etc.  The Meguiar's #40 washed completely off.  It was left worse than before I used the product.  The finish remaining was also very splotchy and looks bad.  Even some interior parts that I applied #40 to were mostly wiped clean after just wiping with a damp towel used to pick up accumulated dust/dirt.  It remained splotchy where there were minor nicks scratches in the plastic/rubber where more #40 had absorbed.Overall, I was very unsatisfied with the results.  I'm not going to say it is the worst product I have ever used, but others that I use are far and away better.  These include 303 Aerospace Protectant which is a very mild, water-based product which also doesn't last but is better than this Meguiars product and has almost no sheen.My previous staple and which I recommend most is actually Armor All Original.  I purchased a Guru Reports analysis on these types of products several years ago and was surprised that this ""old"" product was one of the two best-in-category products (along with Zaino) among over 50 that were tested.  Armor All Original (not other formulations) is very low sheen and also lasts several washes.  It is also about 1/4 the price or less and available everywhere.I'm going back to Armor All Original and recommend that you try it as it performs better than ""boutique"" products.  I would also recommend that you use water-based products on permanent trim, rubber, etc., as the solvent/petroleum-based ones have a tendency to degrade the rubber/plastic over time.  These may be OK for replaceable items like tires or parts that are severely oxidized.

I bought a whole set of oil cap wrenches in a pretty red case from Sears trying to save a few bucks.  The wells were over 1 inch deep. On many of today's new motors, there is not enough room to get a deep-well wrench on the filter.  For example, I bought two brands of oil cap wrenches trying to find one that would fit a 29-HP Kawasaki engine on a Scag Turf Tiger. They both failed. One wouldn't even go onto the oil filter. The one that would go on would not come off after loosening one turn.  So, refusing to give up, I tried the K-D.  It fit perfectly.

But still, it works poorly for me.The selector valve that you use to switch between evacuating/dispensing is ridiculously difficult to operate.  I can't just push or lift my selector valve to operate it.  No, I have to twist it while pushing/pulling like a madman, and hope I don't break anything (including my fingers).  I was able to loosen it up somewhat by spraying the valve with silicone/Teflon spray, and operating it repeatedly.  But (1) It's still not easy to operate, and (2) I shouldn't have to do that.The expandable plug that must be expanded to evacuate/dispense or removed to pour fluid out is ridiculously difficult to remove.  It's just a poor-fitting device.The tube connector where the main evacuation tube enters the top of the unit leaked when I put it in dispense mode.  I had to pay over $27 to get a replacement ""Tube Connector Kit"" (822566), since my unit is out of warranty.After replacing the tube connector and trying dispense mode again, I found that the top plate leaks.  I had not noticed this before, but it explains why it always took so much pumping when I evacuated oil!  When I use it in dispense mode now, the main tube doesn't leak anymore, but air and oil come out from under the top plate.  I removed the top plate, and sure enough, ""Look Ma, no seal!""  It would be bad enough if the seal had merely failed, but for the seal not to be included in the first place is inexcusable.  Because I didn't notice this problem sooner, the seal (822821) is costing me an additional $13, including a ridiculous $8.75 fee for shipping.Now I've added (not replaced--added) the top seal, and while doing a test, I can hear that the unit leaks air at the top of the pump assembly.

1142,A39VLN90M0D8XL,B0002SR7TC,"This thing is well worth it overall.  It's not going to work for every vehicle, however.  My Corolla and my Yukon are both apparently not compatible with the down-the-tube method of oil removal.  For my Crown Vic, and my pre-80's cars, it's simply outstanding.It pulls an amazing amount of oil from the pan, just have to fish around a little with the hose after you get most of the oil out, in order to find any small pockets of oil remaining.  After about 3-4 minutes of suction, I removed the drain plug and checked.  I only got a tablespoon or so of drip, which is pretty good, overall.  Transmission oil is just as easy, but I think you'd be better off slightly elevating the front/rear/side in order to force fluid toward the dipstick because the pans are usually flatter/shallower.Quick, easy, and you can just pump it right back into the empty oil container.  You're still going to get some on you...Finally, my one complaint, there is no way to securely fasten the hose and adapter fittings to the pump when it's not in use.  Minor, but irritating, since the little friction clip is pretty much useless if you bump the hose out.

1143,A31FYZK04YNOJ5,B0002SR7TC,"I have been using oil extractors for a few years now, namely the Pela 6000 marine pump.  Although I am well experienced with cars, I currently have my oilpan drain plug replaced with a temperature sensor, so I prefer not to remove that and risk damaging, plus, I hate having to get under the car and pray not to spill oil everywhere.The Pela pump was great, the big issue was that there was no easy way to drain the container and if you weren't careful, while draining you would tip too far and cause an air bubble which made oil dump out with some force and splash everywhere (think of turning a 2liter bottle upside down).  Unfortunately I had to toss out the pump because it was starting to leak some oil out of the handle.I read some great things on automotive forums about the Mityvac, and was ecstatic to find this particular model that can not only pump, but easily evacuate fluid as well.  This comes in real handy when dealing with fluids such as brake fluid and transmission fluid.  On top of that, it provided me a VERY easy way to extract oil from the pump back into the bottles ;).The pump worked like a charm, and did exactly what it is intended to do.  This is great for my car because although the car holds about 5 quarts of oil, conventional draining from the pan only drains out about 4 quarts as oil is still left in the oil coolers.  Because of the vacuum that this produces inside of the oil sump, I manage to evacuate almost every drop of oil from the system.One note is that you MUST tighten the screws holding on the top cover.

1145,A1OPKNO7IXWV27,B0002SR7TC,"This is basically a manual vacuum to suck up oil or other liquids from inside your engine or other places where oil or fluids are used. It includes everything you need and works pretty well, although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow, so be patient. I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!). I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there. That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in. Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil. Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done. For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands. Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver. The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential). Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm. However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator. Otherwise this is a great tool to have available.

1148,A17CXXQUDPQASN,B0002SR8AK,"After I got my CV from the auction, I ordered some fancy new headlight bulbs for it. They did NOT come with aiming instructions, which seems silly, if you ask me (but, who asked me, right!).If you've ever searched the web for headlight aiming instructions, good luck! No two are alike! I contacted the manufacturer of the bulbs, and even they had vague instructions. This is the best explanation I found: [...]Step one ... put some gas in the tank. The adjustment will fluctuate a little depending on how much gas you have in the tank (yes, I did it on empty the first time and had to re-adjust the height.), and other load/spring/shock conditions.On a flat surface, you drive the car as close as you can up to a wall and mark the center of the headlight beams. This varies from bulb to bulb, and can range from a well defined rectangle, to a somewhat defined ""top,"" and a vague ""bottom."" Some bulbs have a kind of a ""z"" that you align where is zigs and zags.Now, back your vehicle up 25'. This is an ""industry rule of thumb,"" not a mystery, as some manufacturers may have you believe. My lights were shining on the ground at this point, waaaay off!On the back of your lights are little screws with 4 mm hex heads. The top ones towards the outside of the car are for up and down, the lower ones, towards the inside of the car, are for left and right. I tried pliers ... no good, I tried that little crescent wrench ... no good, I went to Sears and bought that pretty miniature set of metric wrenches that goes down to 4 mm for $20 (what was I thinking) ... and I was actually able to do some adjusting by turning and turning the wrench, back and forth, back and forth, dropping it into the frame ... (you know what I'm talkin' 'bout!) ... I did discover (if you're short of cash and have a little wrench already) that by taking the yellow bulb assembly out of the headlight, that the little wrench will spin around without taking it off the post.Since my daughter and I both have these cars, I decided to look for a ""real"" adjustment tool and found this Lisle product. WOW! Now, I can do BOTH headlights, up and down, AND, right and left, in the time it took me to do one screw before! This thing fits perfectly, it ratchets smoothly, and you can pop it on and off easily! It's like a miracle tool! NOTE TO SELF!!! DO ""NOT"" BACK THE ADJUSTER SCREW ALL THE WAY TO THE METAL PANEL BEHIND IT WITH THE TOOL ON THE SCREW! THE TOOL WON'T COME OFF AND YOU CAN'T REVERSE THE TOOL OTHER THAN TO REMOVE IT FROM THE SCREW AND TURN IT AROUND! And, no, I didn't actually do this, but I came darn close!K, I digress, sorry about that! Now, you have your car backed up 25' from the wall, hood open, radiator access panel removed (there's a little thumb screw you turn if you're lucky). Lights on ""low beam,"" then cover one of the lights with a dark towel or something, and it will be easier to see the light you're working on.Vertical adjustment (up and down) ... At this point there are several variations of ""the rule."" I have found on my car that aligning the ""top"" on the headlight pattern at, or just below, the horizontal centerline for the lights that I marked on the wall is good. This is pretty easy to see for any of the bulbs that I have been using.Horizontal adjustment (side to side) ... This varies a lot! The recommendations in the link in this post has you align the ""driver's side"" of the beam rectangles (this varies from aligning the centerline of the beam rectangles to two inches to the right of the centerline in some recommendations, and various other recommendations), just up to the vertical centerlines that we marked on the wall. IF you can actually see a definite outline of the beans, this might work. On one car, the beams are defined, on the other I can NOT see a defined left or right edge on the wall, so I had to ""play it by ear"" and eyeball the adjusters so as to not get them too far in or out, erring on what I thought to be aiming the beams more to the passenger side of the centerlines. Keep in mind that the goal is to illuminate the shoulder, passenger side of the road, the lane you are traveling in, and, I believe, to illuminate somewhat, the oncoming lane without blinding the other driver.Commonsense, and a test drive will tell you if you have it right. If the street signs are glowing like the sun from a mile down the road, you're aimed too high! A quick check of the high beams while in front of the wall may verify your aim. You do NOT adjust high beams, they are supposed to be ""self-aiming"" when the low beams are aimed, however, they should be somewhat centered over those centerlines we marked earlier.The glory of this tool was then, when I did the test run with the radiator access cowling off already, and I could see the beam was too far towards the driver's side (middle) of the road, I just pulled off the road, opened the hood and popped the adjusting tool on the screw, easily flipped it a few turns (you will know which way after you adjust it a few times) and it came out perfect!Please verify all information, this can be dangerous for everyone if it's not done correctly.

1215,A30UFXOF0GS9NM,B0002SRL20,"I originally boughtARB ARB605 Blue Inflator with Gauge and Braided Hosebut it had a leaking hose, so I returned it and got this.  A number of people say the gauge on this is too small.  I don't think the numbers on the gauge are much smaller than on the ARB Blue, but the Milton's gauge does feel harder to read.  I think it has more to do with the gauge being deeply inset behind thick glass/oil so light doesn't penetrate quite as easily as on the ARB's gauge, and the fact its measurement line is silver metal instead of bright red like the needle in the ARB's gauge.  Using a silver metal line is just stupid because it's a low contrast against a white background and black text and the silver partly reflects white light depending on how light strikes it making it even harder to see.  I think whoever designed this gauge ""back in the day"" decided it was somehow perfect and never needed any tweaks despite user complaints and other companies coming up with some better ideas.The junction between the red hose and gold pipe rotates which is nice if you want to push the filler against the tire at a convenient angle and still read the gauge.  The ARB doesn't have that feature which can leave its gauge hard to read because on a lot of tires you can only clip the hose on at a certain angle.One of the reviewers said the gauge measured pressure as you filled the tire, but that isn't true.  The gauge goes to zero while you fill, just like every other tire filler I've ever used, and only measures when you're not filling.  The gauge itself measured an identical value to a hand-held gauge I've been using forever.The description says the Milton has a ""dual chuck"" which I thought maybe meant you could rotate the silver end to press either side to the tire and one side might be made to connect to a different style of air connection.  But the silver part does not rotate and the air connection on both sides is identical.  I got the impression from another review that having a connection on the other side is useful if you have to push the hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect (ieLegacy A73457D Color Connex Type D 7 Piece 1/4 in. Red Coupler and Plug Kit).The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.Despite the shortcomings, the Milton is much more solidly constructed than the ARB and the hose doesn't leak.",Auto,2012-11-28,4,positive,originally boughtarb arb605 blue inflator gauge braided hosebut leaking hose returned got number people say gauge small dont think numbers gauge much smaller arb blue but miltons gauge feel harder read think gauge deeply inset behind thick glassoil light doesnt penetrate quite easily arbs gauge fact measurement line silver metal instead bright red needle arbs gauge using silver metal line stupid low contrast white background black text silver partly reflects white light depending light strikes making even harder see think whoever designed gauge back day decided somehow perfect never needed tweaks despite user complaints companies coming better ideasthe junction red hose gold pipe rotates nice want push filler tire convenient angle still read gauge arb doesnt feature leave gauge hard read lot tires clip hose certain angleone reviewers said gauge measured pressure filled tire but isnt true gauge goes zero fill every tire filler ive ever measures youre not filling gauge measured identical value handheld gauge ive using foreverthe description says milton dual chuck thought maybe meant could rotate silver end press either side tire one side might made connect different style air connection but silver part not rotate air connection sides identical got impression another review connection side useful push hose tight space pull chuck back onto air connectionthe arb comes type quick disconnect already screwed but milton supply sealing tape screw quick disconnect ielegacy a73457d color connex type piece red coupler plug kitthe arb button release pressure youre inflating but milton no feature dont think difficult release pressure chuck let air escape tire thats probably easier using pressurerelease button anyway plus button creates another point fail manufacture youve owned tool awhiledespite shortcomings milton much solidly constructed arb hose doesnt leak,0.07880952380952382,negative,-1.0,negative,positive

I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.

Since then, the car has set under the carport, uncovered, collecting dirt and grime. Its only use has been to serve as our cats ""perch"". You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked. Truthfully, I was skeptical... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try. So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally. I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing. After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner. I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible. So I applied a second coat of cleaner. That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, preceded by the step 1 cleaner, and step 2 sealer has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint. They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint). But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition. I ran short and had to buy a second bottle. In my mind, that's a small price to pay.The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit called the Ultimate Wax System.

Period.I started using this product and noticed the difference right away. Seriously, this is the most underrated wax on the market. Anyone with a black car should give this wax a shot and I will make a bet that you too will see the difference.  Even my coworkers saw the difference right away.  Just by switching to this wax.  They commented that it was ""brighter and really glossy"".This wax does provide a very nice, reflective shine.  Very easy to apply and wipe off. You won't be disappointed with this wax.  Other waxes (especially those synthetic polymers wax) Such as NXT requires that you wait at least  20 minutes for the wax to dry before you buff it out.

But these black plastic parts had begun to fade after about 2 years. The car is even garage kept most of the time. Many of the black trim restoring products on Amazon have a wide range of reviews; from 1 to 5 stars for most if not every similar product. I chose Mothers because I use many of their other products, typically with good results. Back to Black did not disappoint. I applied it to the plastic trim around the fascia using ""12pcs Waxing Polish Wax Foam Sponge Applicator Pads Fit for Clean Car Vehicle Auto Glass High_quality Yellow Useful NEW"" (from Amazon) which are ideal for this task. Mothers instructions state that the area should be buffed after application. I found buffing unnecessary on the trim around the fascia. I did try buffing at first, but these areas are somewhat rough-textured and seemed to absorb the liquid fairly quickly. Buffing did not change the appearance.However, on the door pillars, the texture is smooth and buffing did make a appreciable difference there. Buffing with a soft towel helped to more evenly distribute the Back to Black, eliminating some minor streaking resulting from application. Buffing also improved the gloss of the black color, which would have been more like flat black prior to buffing. So whether to buff or not depends on the type of material where the product is being applied. Back to Black is also very good at removing any excess wax that gets on the fascia trim areas.Most of the negative reviews of this and similar black detailing products are because they need periodic reapplication. I found this to be true also of Back to Black. But no black detailer is going to be a miracle product and last forever.

A couple of things impressed me, it really evened out the blemishes and brought all the trim to a consistent black color.

Since then, the car has set under the carport, uncovered, collecting dirt and grime.  Its only use has been to serve as our cats ""perch"".  You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked.  Truthfully, I was skeptical... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try.  So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally.  I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing.  After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner.  I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible.  So I applied a second coat of cleaner.  That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, followed by the step 2 sealer, and step 3 carnuba wax has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint.  They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint).  But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition.  I ran short and had to buy a second bottle.  In my mind, that's a small price to pay.The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit called the Ultimate Wax System.

And boy does it make my car look REAL good!Although this polish won't cut harsh enough to remove swirl marks and scratches, it seems to ""hide"" swirl marks and make them less visible (possibly by smoothing out the microscopic edges?).  Add to the fact that it doubles as a glaze/sealer, and it fills up the swirl marks and scratches.  Scratches are still visible, but the edges are smoothed out and less visible from farther away.  Swirl marks are still visible, but only up close and takes a tiny bit more focusing to see them.  So, it doesn't cure scratches or swirl marks very well, but what does it do best?

I own an 06 scion TC and pampered it with the steps above. but then tragedy... minor scuffs from the kids getting out of the back seat. Careless people brushing their groceries/backpacks/fat butts against my freaggin car!after all the scuffs and scratches washing was the only real priority now, years later I look at my once gorgeous car and think to myself it still looks ... okay. then i miss that feeling of satisfaction of that wet/glossy look. I tried waxing which made the car shiny but the scars still remained, it only covered the lightest of scratches at most.Review:Then by looking up any new clay bar kits i happened to see amazon recommend a 3 step from mothers car care products. I didnt know about sealants, and after reading it i bought the whole kit and was surprised. step one cleaned well enough, but step 2 made those pesky scratches less noticeable, only I would see them since I know where they are. the deeper ones are still their but the glaze makes it so shiny its hard to focus on the scratches, which are usually the focus of a car.

It is very mild and will take off old wax and oxidation, but it will NOT remove most swirl marks and scratches. (Consider something else if you're looking to cure these pre-wax!).  This polish would be more beneficial on cars with old wax and/or oxidation.  On newer vehicles, although this is not necessary unless you want to remove any previous wax you might have done, it's still worth using just for a peace of mind kind of thing.  It'll help revitalize the color on oxidized paint and it'll enhance the depth and color of non-oxidized paint.On my car, a Mazda3 in Galaxy Grey Mica, there was no oxidized paint, but after using this polish, it brings out the color a little bit more via the clear coat.

1424,A3OJD6ZRN2BKLH,B0002U26QE,"I like Mother's products. They are affordable, and work well when used correctly. The thing about mothers is it is not the best on the market, but as for price, availability, and ease of use any novice to car detailing can make a car look stunning.personal processI wash my car and used a clay bar to before using this product. The clay will remove heavy contaminants and prep the surface to be smooth. It so happens I use the mothers california gold clay bar kit which IMO is the best for the price. The detailer is just ok, the clay is great and so is the premium microfiber towel. The reason why I mentioned all of this is that you need to prep your car before starting to use the 1-2-3 system.So on to the actual review, the step one part they call a pre wax cleaner. If I'm not mistaken it is either a very mild type of car polish and may contain abrasives. Basically it will smooth out your cars surface, and make it shiny from the clear coat surface. I think it did a fair job making it shine and removing surface residue from the clay and detailer. It did an okay job so far with very light swirlmarks. since I am unfamiliar with other polishing compounds that I have been hearing about I will give this product of 3.5 rounded to 4 stars. just because I like it enough for the ease of use/money/amount and ending result. I may change the rating if I like other products I try in the future. but for this price and the amount they give (16oz) this will last me awhile because its 1-2 times a year use. now thats bang for the buck.

1429,A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B0002U2V1Y,"I learned about Gold Clay Bars in a Honda CRV forum, where car enthusiasts shared their favorite products.This was three years ago. Since then I clay my car twice a year, in the spring  and the the fall.I just finished my spring treatment when a fellow walked by my car and asked if this was 2011 CRV that I waswashing.  I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it.  I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip.  This keeps it pliable and clean.  It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package.  If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes.  Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat.  Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. This year we had a rough winter and I had some rubber marks from my snow removal tool in addition to the regular dirt specs.  Clay did a great job on removing those marks.I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome. It does a great job as well. After the claying step I wax the car is small sections.Mothers 05701 California Gold Carnauba Cleaner Wax Liquid - 16 ozAs my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces.

1430,A4WCZVA328QB4,B0002U2V1Y,"I have a 1998 Ram pickup that spends its entire life outside, parked near trees.  I hadn't done much with paint care for more than a couple years and one side was covered in small, hard, brown tree sap spots.  Reading the reviews on Amazon (and other websites) for clay bars and their use in cleaning up paint surfaces, I thought I'd try this Mother's kit to revitalize my paint job.  I was sceptical about its abilities to do anything other than a final ""fine cleaning"".  I was right.The clay bar could not remove any of the hard tree sap marks.  It does not remove scratches (and can actually apply some if you do not keep the clay lubricated.  It does make the paint seem smoother to the touch, but I cannot tell the difference between a final normally waxed and polished surface and a clayed waxed and polished surface.  The surface feel of unpolished paint Vs clayed paint does exhibit a noticeable benefit from claying, as the makers claim.  However, applying a good polish achieves the same results on a washed and clean paint surface, in my opinion.  Even on my truck, after cleaning it first, the clay stayed pretty clean and only after doing the whole vehicle paint surface did the clay feel faintly gritty and appear slightly darker in color - ready for trashing.To remove the sap, I resorted to a rag soaked in mineral spirits and plenty of elbow grease.  To eliminate any light scratches, I used T-Cut.  Then I clayed it, followed by polishing with Turtle Wax.  After a day of that, my shoulders ached bad, but the truck paintwork looks good; well, as good as an 11 year old, well-used, stone-chipped and scratched truck can.  The clearcoat has actually held up exceedingly well over the years.I haven't tried clay on our 3 year old, garaged minivan yet.  It will be interesting to see if it removes minor swirl marks.  I don't expect it to make the paint look any shinier after polishing. It looks great as it is.I did buy an extra bottle of detailing spray (I bought the kit locally at Autozone) in case one wasn't enough.  But one was enough for one clay bar / one vehicle treatment.  Since there are two clay bars in the kit, then the extra bottle will be used with the second bar.I found the claying to be easy and quite quick.  I split the bar in two, then pressed it flat into a disc about 2"" in diameter.  Then I sprayed the surface and rubbed the clay back and forth over the paint in my palm.  Knead it regularly back into the 2"" disc, as it gets thinner and splits.  It was actually very straightforward and no big deal.  Avoid rubber parts, like the windshield surround, as the clay picked up black ""soot"" from those.  Make sure you polish it dry as the spray leaves streaks if you don't remove it with the supplied towelI suggest clay bars are really for the guys and gals that want the ultimate care for their newer vehicles.  It may not be noticed by anyone else, but it's the satisfaction of a job well done that always matters to the perfectionist!  I know 'cos I am one!Sept 26 2009 UPDATE:  This evening, I tried claying half the hood of my minivan then waxing it all to see if I could tell any difference.  The clearcoat on the van is in great condition.  I washed the hood and dried it.  Then I clayed the left half (LH as seated in the van).  I did notice that even with plenty of spray lubricant there were a few faint straight line, light scratches visible in the clearcoat after I wiped the surface dry that weren't there before claying.  I could not feel any real difference in the surface smoothness from the clayed to the unclayed side. The clay appeared to have no visible dirt in it.  I then Turtle Wax'd the whole hood.  After that, the straight line scratches were gone and there was no VISUAL difference from clayed to unclayed even with the reflected overhead flourescent light from my garage as a guide.  I then applied my dry finger tips to the hood; left hand on the unclayed side and right hand on the clayed side.  Applying a light pressure and sliding back and forth, I think I detected a slight reduction in friction as the fingers change direction on the clayed side.  Even swapping hands over, the result seemed the same, ruling out differences in my finger tips!  However, the effect was so slight that it was almost imperceptible.CONCLUSION:  Claying may help with a contaminated paint surface to remove those last little imperfections and revive the paint, but with a clean and regularly-waxed paint surface, claying probably isn't worth the cost nor the effort.",Auto,2009-09-24,3,positive,ram pickup spends entire life outside parked near trees hadnt done much paint care couple years one side covered small hard brown tree sap spots reading reviews websites clay bars cleaning paint surfaces thought id try mothers kit revitalize paint job sceptical abilities anything final fine cleaning rightthe clay bar could not remove hard tree sap marks not remove scratches actually apply not keep clay lubricated make paint seem smoother touch but not tell difference final normally waxed polished surface clayed waxed polished surface surface feel unpolished paint vs clayed paint exhibit noticeable benefit claying makers claim however applying good polish achieves results washed clean paint surface opinion even truck cleaning first clay stayed pretty clean whole vehicle paint surface clay feel faintly gritty appear slightly darker color ready trashingto remove sap resorted rag soaked mineral spirits plenty elbow grease eliminate light scratches tcut clayed followed polishing turtle wax day shoulders ached bad but truck paintwork looks good well good year old wellused stonechipped scratched truck clearcoat actually held exceedingly well yearsi havent tried clay year old garaged minivan yet interesting see removes minor swirl marks dont expect make paint look shinier polishing looks great isi extra bottle detailing spray bought kit locally autozone case one wasnt enough but one enough one clay bar one vehicle treatment since two clay bars kit extra bottle second bari found claying easy quite quick split bar two pressed flat disc diameter sprayed surface rubbed clay back forth paint palm knead regularly back disc gets thinner splits actually straightforward no big deal avoid rubber parts windshield surround clay picked black soot make sure polish dry spray leaves streaks dont remove supplied toweli suggest clay bars really guys gals want ultimate care newer vehicles may not noticed anyone else but satisfaction job well done always matters perfectionist know cos onesept update evening tried claying half hood minivan waxing see could tell difference clearcoat van great condition washed hood dried clayed left half lh seated van notice even plenty spray lubricant faint straight line light scratches visible clearcoat wiped surface dry werent claying could not feel real difference surface smoothness clayed unclayed side clay appeared no visible dirt turtle waxd whole hood straight line scratches gone no visual difference clayed unclayed even reflected overhead flourescent light garage guide applied dry finger tips hood left hand unclayed side right hand clayed side applying light pressure sliding back forth think detected slight reduction friction fingers change direction clayed side even swapping hands result seemed ruling differences finger tips however effect slight almost imperceptibleconclusion claying may help contaminated paint surface remove last little imperfections revive paint but clean regularlywaxed paint surface claying probably isnt worth cost effort,0.11348938223938226,positive,36.0,positive,positive

It doesn't work miracles like that, but it really does work if you use on a car that hasn't been allowed to rot or been forgotten. This product works best when used after a thorough wash. Some people use it while washing, but I feel this can have a negative effect as it may help to embed dirt and contaminants instead of allowing the suds to lift and carry them away. Plenty of the included spray detailer must be used or else the clay will stick to the car. I personally don't rub too aggressively, and I don't believe that is necessary. After the clay the residue is wiped away with a microfiber cloth. While you can leave the car as is, it is a really good idea to put on a coat of wax immediately after claying the car. You will be amazed at how smooth and slick the car's paint will be after just claying, and with the wax it'll feel like you greased the surface. The results can be incredible if you are patient and follow the directions. The only thing to remember is that if the clay bar ever falls on the ground it must be thrown away.

1451,A24RT6AVJXJZHF,B0002U2V1Y,"I just bought my first car at the age of 42.  I once had a car assigned to me for two years, but other than that I've only had single day rentals.  So of course, in the honeymoon stage with my 2007 Honda Element, I wanted to make it look as beautiful as possible before showing it off to my family at Thanksgiving.So I went to a local pro detailer.  To hand wash and vacuum out the car it would be $25; to clay bar the car and do the wash it's $75; full detailing cost $150.  That's pretty decent, and I wouldn't mind paying to have the pro do the job, but for $18 I wanted to try clay barring it myself.The instructions couldn't be simpler, though I would add that you should at least rinse off the car and let it air dry for a few minutes before starting to clay bar.  You don't have to be particularly gentle or slow about it, and don't worry about getting the chamois dirty--you can wash it or just get another one for cheap.Just spray, rub, wipe it down with the cloth, and move on to the next spot until you've done the whole car.  Don't worry about getting into ever single little nook and cranny.  I imagine even the pros don't bother with that unless they're literally working on a showpiece.Trust me, you couldn't fail to be happy with the results, and for $18 why not try.When you're finished clay barring the car, take it to a car wash for a nice wash and wax (or do that yourself as well) and see the gorgeous results.  The car will look as new as it possibly could.Lastly, I want to dispell a myth about clay barring.  I heard--from a pro amongst others--that what clay barring does is reverse the oxydization of the paint which makes the finish dull, amongst other wierd science theories.  That's rediculous; car wax does that.  All clay barring does is pick up tiny bits of stuff--airborn metal specks, asphalt dust, microscopic bits of rock, space debris--which have become embedded in the paint.  That's it.

1462,A2ES8N7CVWICZY,B0002U2V1Y,"This was my first time claying my vehicle. I will say that it does what it says: I tried it on a small part of my car to test it out, and it certainly smoothes the rough, presumably contaminated surface. You can hear and feel the crunchy layer being lifted away, and the paint is returned to a like-new slickness. The process also seemed to make for a much nicer finish after waxing. Count me as another believer in the power of clay.If I were you, reading this review and wondering if this is the right purchase for your first-time claying (I must have spent several hours Googling and browsing Amazon for info; I know what you're going through), I would want to be told this: Buy a separate clay bar, and use soapy water for lubricant. Use the saved money to buy a nice bottle of car wash.At first I was hesitant to use soapy water instead of the detailer spray that came with it, but after some research I discovered that many professional detailers use soapy water (there are YouTube vids with professionals using soap suds for claying). I even did a test at first, using soapy water on one area and the detail spray on another, and the clay process worked just as well with soap (or auto shampoo, rather). Just be sure the water is very sudsy and constantly applied. I wound up using the Showtime spray to clay about half the car, and I nearly used up the entire bottle. Maybe I used too much, but I only sprayed enough to cover the surface (a 2010 Accord), and with something like this I figure too much lubricant is better than too little. Detailing spray isn't exactly expensive, but using the spray instead of soap could easily result in adding $5-$10 to the task. If it offered better performance over soapy water, that would be one thing, but it doesn't seem to.Before washing the car I tried using the spray alone as a detailer on a lightly dusty surface, and it cleaned well. I wish I had just used soapy water for the entire clay process and saved the detail spray for its original purpose. In that sense, this kit is probably a nice value along with the microfiber cloth (also pretty nice quality). I can't comment on the quality of the clay bar since it's the only one I've used. It was soft and didn't fall apart. I didn't see the huge amount of contaminants on the bar like you see in some customer photos (hardly any, really, but maybe my contaminants were of the transparent sort), but it definitely had an impact on surface smoothness.It was a good learning experience and good value considering everything it comes with. However, in the future I'll buy a separate clay bar.

1463,A1VQHH85U7PX0,B0002U2V1Y,"After reading numerous raving reviews here at Amazon.com and at several other sites, and learning that auto clay was safe for clear coat paints because it works through a non-abrasive process, I decided to give it a try -- and boy, was I glad I did!My car was covered with a stubborn deposit of dirt and grime that simply would not come off with a car wash. It seemed that the dirt and grime had gotten lodged in the paint and wouldn't budge no matter how hard I tried washing the car. After every car wash, I would run my fingers through the paint and it would still feel gritty.That was when I learned about Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit. The results were astounding! After using it, the paint no longer felt gritty but glassy-smooth. The paint was no longer dulled by contaminants and the car looked like it had a new coat of paint! I was immensely pleased with the results.Unlike a lot of car polish or polishing compounds that use abrasion to strip away surface contaminants, auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants and locks them into the clay. The clay looks and feels exactly like plasticine (Play-doh) and it is used along with the included ""lubricant"" spray (actually, an auto soap that provide lots of suds -- like Meguiar's Gold Class -- will work equally well.)Mind you, car polish still has its place in paint restoration because claying will not remove scratches; only a car polish or a polishing compound (harsher) can do that. And remember, always follow the claying with an application of wax to shield your paint from new contaminants. Also, clay your car every so often and you will keep the paint looking like new!I am giving Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit my highest recommendation.

1474,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0002U2V1Y,"When a neighbor doing some spray painting got some paint spots on my car, I first tried removing them using a razor scraper and water.  This worked, but it was pretty time consuming, and required a lot of care, so I decided to try Mothers California Gold clay bar kit.  The kit contains two bars of clay, a microfiber towel, and a spray bottle of Showtime Instant Detailer.I found that while the clay product does a pretty good job of removing dirt, sap, and small particles, adhering to the paint finish, it doesn't do much for removing paint spots.  For the uninitiated, using this product effectively requires developing a certain technique, particularly if you have a thick layer of gunk on your finish.Firstly, the surface you are treating should be cleaned of surface dirt, and cool.  The Instant Detailer spray is pretty slippery, and there is very little friction when sliding the clay bar across a surface sprayed with this stuff.  What you want to try to do is have a thin layer of the Detailer solution on the area, so you can slide the clay over the surface, but still get enough friction so the clay can pickup and remove particles from the finish.  If you have never done this before, it may take some trial and error to develop a technique that works.Since the clay is soft, it is constantly changing its shape as you use it, and from time to time, you will need to reshape it.  One thing to be very aware of, is not getting any debris into the clay.  If you accidentally drop the clay on the ground and happen to get a small rock, piece of metal, or other hard substance stuck in the clay, you could do some major damage to your finish, if you use the clay.  I store the clay in a small zip lock bag, and always be sure to have a zip lock with me when working, to try and keep the clay from picking up something that could be destructive.The bottom line is that the product works pretty well, but you will probably need to have a decent technique, and plenty of muscle to get the job done.  The process is not a simple spray on and wipe off, it will require some time and physical effort to do an entire vehicle.  The clay works on all kinds of finishes, but probably produces the best results on smoother finishes, as there is less friction.

1578,A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B0002UNOYM,"I give my 4 year old car a full cleaning treatment at least twice a year.  About a month ago when I just finished my pre-winter car cleaning ritual a neighbor walked by and ask me if it was a new car shining in my drive way.  That's when you know the wax did its job well.Meguiar Gold Liquid Wax not only does a great job, it is easy to work with if you follow simple steps below:WASHI wash the car first using a detergent designed for car washing, as it removes the grime better. I use microfiber towels to wash.  What you use to wash makes a big difference, a good micro fiber towel makes the job go faster and it does a good job with the smallest amount of effort.BE COOLI wash either in the shade or in the evening when the sun is not strong. Strong sun will dry out the water too soon and working with dry finish can lead to small abrasions. Hot paint finish is also easier to damage. So I make sure the car is cool while I am working on it. I wash the top of the car, then the bottom of the car.  I don't want dirty water streaming down on the clean portions.DRYThen I dry the car which helps remove whatever dirt might have remained on the car after the wash.  I use more micro fiber towels.  I like Costco's micro fiber towel bag, for $10 you get a big bag of high quality towels of just the right size.CLAYI check the car for any dirt that the water did not take off and clay those areas.  I don't clay the entire car, just the areas where I see imperfections.WAXI apply the wax to another micro fiber towel, spread it on a small portion of the car (3 feet by 3 feet), then wipe it off with another micro fiber towel.  If you let the wax sit too long it will become difficult to buff off, that's why working on small areas is better.  If I drop a towel, I move on to the next one.  Even tiny dirt particles you can't see will scratch the paint surface.  I try avoid getting wax on plastic parts.  If I do get it on the plastic parts, see ""back to black"" described below.BACK To BLACKThe final step is to apply Back to black solution to plastic parts of the car.  It makes the plastic look new, and it is not harmful to the painted surfaces. Back to black solution effectively removes any wax residue you might have gotten on to the plastic parts, it also takes care of the sun damage to the plastic.This procedure takes me about an hour.  I love riding in a shiny clean car plus I always get great value back when I sell my cars.Meguiar's Gold Wax is one of my ""secret"" weapons to make a four year old car look like new.

This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.

I buffed it off in the opposite direction of the way it was applied and the luster and shine is really incredible.  I used Meguiar's microfiber towels to remove the glaze.

So while this product looks great, it's only lasted about a month...that isn't gonna cut it.  I'm not waxing my truck 12 times a year.  I've read great things about the newly released Ultimate Liquid wax which has the newest in wax technological advances and has some amazing polymer properties...so I bought 2 bottles of it and will wax sometime in the next couple of weeks.  Per Meguiar's, they say that the ultimate liquid wax will out-last ANY of their other waxes and because of the newest advances in the wax formula itself,...I'm anxious to use it.  Once I do, rest assured i'll be leaving a review for that too.

Then, sometime a few years later, NXT 2.0 was introduced and to me, it was a huge step backwards.  Although it just received a highly favorable rating from the big consumer magazine, it is far from one of the best products on the market.  This version 2.0 has very poor gloss characteristics on dark colored cars and the durability is just terrible, literally no more than six weeks before water stops sheeting off the car.I maintain eight different personal cars and so am almost always waxing something.  I think all the high priced, multi-step products are just so much snake oil being sold at outrageous prices and trust me, I've tried almost all of them.  Good surface prep is the key to the success of any wax/synthetic product and that involves clay, light cut cleaner, polish and then the final way.  Once prepped properly, just about any product will do really well and, if applied regularly, will protect the finish and make future preps unnecessary.

1697,A1D9V4TAFTO6M2,B0002YTN4I,"I've had a good experience with these ramps. They're easy to line up, wide enough to provide confidence, and they seem plenty strong. They're light enough to be very easy to lift and move around.These ramps are not hollow shells; they have supports on the inside. Because of this, you cannot place one ramp inside the other for storage.It took a few times for me to get used to driving up these ramps.  Let's face it, driving up an incline in your garage is not something you are probably used to.  The second time I did it, my tires hit the raised lip on the ramp (the one designed to stop the wheels) pretty hard.  When it did this, it made a loud noise, and I suffered a moment of terror before I realized that nothing was wrong.I decided it would be much easier to drive up these ramps if I could see what I was doing.  So, I bought a cheap full-length mirror at Target (the kind designed to be mounted on the inside of a bedroom door).  Now when I use these ramps, I set the mirror down on my garage floor lengthwise, leaning against the wall, adjusted so I can see my front driver-side tire the whole time.  This has made it vastly easier to drive up the ramps with confidence--and without killing my transmission. The same trick also makes backing down the ramps easier. It's important to be going extremely slowly at the point when the tires leave the ramps and make first contact with the floor. If you're going too fast, the suspension will bounce, which (depending on the vehicle) could damage something when the underside of the vehicle hits the higher portion of the ramps.",Auto,2011-02-10,5,positive,ive good experience ramps theyre easy line wide enough provide confidence seem plenty strong theyre light enough easy lift move aroundthese ramps not hollow shells supports inside not place one ramp inside storageit took times get driving ramps lets face driving incline garage not something probably second time tires hit raised lip ramp one designed stop wheels pretty hard made loud noise suffered moment terror realized nothing wrongi decided would much easier drive ramps could see bought cheap fulllength mirror target kind designed mounted inside bedroom door ramps mirror garage floor lengthwise leaning wall adjusted see front driverside tire whole time made vastly easier drive ramps confidenceand without killing transmission trick also makes backing ramps easier important going extremely slowly point tires leave ramps make first contact floor youre going fast suspension bounce depending vehicle could damage something underside vehicle hits higher portion ramps,0.20036231884057976,positive,3.0,positive,positive

It actually has a 2/4 Drop and 20"" Wheels with 275/45R20 Tires.  I was on my Asphalt Driveway,  I put the Ramps right it front of my front tires, Get into my truck, and drove right up them!!! Didn't slip AT ALL.  There is a Rubber Pad in the middle Front, pretty thick, not large,  but it seemed to work for me.  I used to be a Professional Mechanic 3 months ago, and always had access to Racks.  I Changed Occupations for the better, and so I no longer have Rack access.  So I got a set of these.Again my truck is lowered, and so I was worried about a ramp not fitting under the front of my truck to drive up.  I had no problem with these like I said.  I put them right up Against the tire, and then drove right on up!!!  The Negative is it's not UP very high, at least on my lowered truck.  On my Low to the ground creeper, I could just get under to change the oil and oil filter.  I wanted to change the Fuel filter also, but that was ALMOST impossible.  It's along the frame railing back a bit near the front of the Gas tank,  I could barley get back enough to just reach the filter and 2 wrench it with one hand to get the filter off.  I did manage though.  I wish I could of do it on a rack at my old Job, but my old Boss is P.Oed that I left.  Now he has to work far more and hired a couple Idiots to take my place.  I wouldn't get my car worked on there now!!!I'm not going to knock it down any stars because it didn't lift my truck up enough as I knew how much it would raise it before I ordered them.  Again, No slipping for my truck and it's Rear Wheel Drive!!!  It didn't Sink in the Asphalt, or Crack, or anything else.  Nice and Solid.

Just squeeze a little onto a soft cloth, rub on the metal for a minute or two and buff off to a brilliant shine.HINT:  This polish works awesome to restore the lustre on many metals, but be careful when using this on items that are metal plated or made of lower quality metals because Simichrome will buff the metal right off of it.

It fits on my SUV and truck but is too large for my car wheel wells, and as another reviewer stated, it does not fit on all SUV's and trucks.Pros: It is easy to use, convenient, sturdy when it fits a vehicle.Cons: Time consuming to adjust the step (three positions, but you will likely choose one and leave it; it has 2 thumb screws and painted metal that fits tightly with holes being difficult to line up), the storage bag only fits it if it is left in the shipped position (lowest); it does not fit in the bag if you change the step to a different position. Therefore, if it is changed just leave it out of the bag, or take the time to change it back.If it was designed to change height with push buttons like for the tire width adjustment, and had a bag that fit in all positions it would get more stars. If this is not what you want to work with for a ~$30 investment, maybe a $19 Rubbermaid step-stool from Costco would be better and more easily positioned, like for washing your car where there is no wheel to anchor to.

1757,A1G8USRY17IR1X,B0002Z9L8K,"When I received Heininger 1020 CommuteMate ""Flameless Flare"", I had high hopes... real flares can be dangerous, messy, and difficult to use. I thought this might be the perfect thing to place in my old truck in the event I had a break-down. I also thought it might be good to take on my ATV trips in the event I break down on the trail and need to leave some kind of visible marker on my ATV along the trail.Sad to say, I was rather disappointed. The flare is powered by two AAA batteries and a single red LED. In the daylight, the light output from the flare is barely noticeable. At night-time it is slightly more noticeable and might serve as a marker light on your car to someone who is paying attention. Or, if you were using it on a dark trail, it might be visible from a short distance. But it really is no brighter than the keyfob LEDs that are intended to assist in unlocking a door. The light is also uni-directional (only coming from one side of the flare), so careful positioning would be a must. I think it would be tricky to use as a map light, too, since maps often contain red text which would be difficult to see with a red light.That said, I will not go as far as to claim that the product mis-represents itself. It is re-usable, and it could function as a secondary warning marker. It is not flammable, and it came with batteries which seems rare these days. The idea for the magnetic end that sticks to the sides of vehicles would be good, if most vehicles were made of steel. But many these days are made of fiberglass or aluminum and thus the magnet serves a limited purpose.If this product were marketed as a sort of a secondary marker light, it might be acceptable. One could place it on top of their car or on the trunk as a ""failsafe"". After all, the more lights the better. However, the idea that it would serve as a ""flare"" is just not correct. If I were changing a tire along the side of a busy road, for example, I would have NO faith that anyone would see or notice this light in their headlights.

Well yes, sort of. The unit has a small lens powered by an LED that either blinks on and off, or lights up continuously. The continuous on is meant for a low-glare map light, while the blinking feature is meant to capture the attention of oncoming motorists. Unfortunately, the LED is not very bright, and is likely to go unnoticed from anyone farther away than 15 to 20 yards, and is so small and low intensity that even if noticed, it is doubtful anyone would recognize it as a hazard or warning beacon. While we certainly don't want anything so bright it blinds oncoming drivers, we also don't want something so dim that it doesn't trigger anyone's warning instincts soon enough.Interstate highway? Forget it, buy some reflective triangles. Rural highways? Not much of a chance of being seen in time at highway speeds. Well lit neighborhoods? It likely won't get noticed. From my perspective, about the only time a unit like this would attract any attention is if it was on a poorly lit rural backroad where the speed limit is 35 mph or under, and there are no other lights in the area to cause any distraction or overpower the weak light source this unit provides. Then, if your vehicle's hazard flashers don't work, by all means this is better than absolutely nothing.

1762,ATOKT8QYK967L,B0002Z9L8K,"Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing.

1773,A13W04LMNR3UQ0,B0002Z9O8C,"This hitch extension is &#34;adjustable&#34; because it has two holes on the &#34;male&#34; end of the receiver, and two holes on the &#34;female&#34; end.  Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.

As received, the chrome finish is fine, but after reading reviews about it deteriorating, I gave it a coat of Simoniz front and back including the mounting tabs before mounting. Hope it will help to retard oxidation. I replaced the UGLY black dealership advertising frame with this one and it looks great. Many cars have only two mounting screw anchors at the top of the plate. Initially with the two screws tightened, the bottom of the plate stuck out. I had to gently bend the license plate very slightly to make it not quite flat so it fit flush with the frame at the bottom and all around. It might also be corrected by adding two SHORT mounting screws and nuts to attach the bottom of the plate to only the frame tabs.The ""perimeter"" frame mounts BEHIND the license plate hiding the mounting tabs, thereby exposing the entire plate: just the simple narrow chrome frame shows. Also, no grief from fussy police or vehicle inspectors because of an obscured state name, motto, etc. I found very few available perimeter frames and for Amazon's cheap price of this one, if it only lasts a year I'll buy a couple more of them.

Considering the cost of these mounting brackets, I wish manufacturers included them as standard equipment; it would show their attention to detail.When I found Cruiser Accessories 79150 Mounting Plate it seemed like a good value.  I especially liked multiple slots for mounting onto the bumper.  These slots provide a good number of mounting and adjustment options.  I used the upper two vertical slots because they were spaced exactly like the existing holes in my car's front bumper.Unfortunately, there was a couple of frustrating issues that spoiled the experience:1.  Four screws that are included with the plate are too long.  I saw them being long and I am glad I checked for this before installing the mounting plate onto the front bumper.  I used included four screws to attach the license plate and the Black Cruiser Accessories 20050 Classic Lite frame to the mounting plate - screws' sharp tips protruded 1/4"" from the back of the mounting plate.  If I had installed the mounting plate onto the bumper first and then tried to attach the license plate with the included screws, I would have damaged the front bumper in two places (the bottom two holes ended up over an air intake slot on my car).  I expect all pieces included with the product to be carefully engineered for that product and working properly.  These screws, obviously, are of the wrong size.  The fact that I had to go to Home Depot to find properly fitting screws not only was frustrating, but also increased the overall cost.2.  The thin pieces of plastic at the top and bottom of the mounting plate are too flimsy.  When I unpacked the plate, these areas of the mounting plate were slightly deformed: bent inwards. Fortunately, the license plate covered the problem.When the mounting plate is installed, it looks nice, so I am not completely disappointed; however, I found a similar product from Bell at Autozone, and it was cheaper (though Bell's mounting plate had very long screws too).",Auto,2009-11-01,3,positive,bothers front license plate screwed directly bumper considering cost mounting brackets wish manufacturers included standard equipment would show attention detailwhen found cruiser accessories mounting plate seemed good value especially liked multiple slots mounting onto bumper slots provide good number mounting adjustment options upper two vertical slots spaced exactly existing holes cars front bumperunfortunately couple frustrating issues spoiled experience four screws included plate long saw long glad checked installing mounting plate onto front bumper included four screws attach license plate black cruiser accessories classic lite frame mounting plate screws sharp tips protruded back mounting plate installed mounting plate onto bumper first tried attach license plate included screws would damaged front bumper two places bottom two holes ended air intake slot car expect pieces included carefully engineered working properly screws obviously wrong size fact go home depot find properly fitting screws not frustrating but also increased overall cost thin pieces plastic top bottom mounting plate flimsy unpacked plate areas mounting plate slightly deformed bent inwards fortunately license plate covered problemwhen mounting plate installed looks nice not completely disappointed however found similar bell autozone cheaper though bells mounting plate long screws,0.13655913978494627,positive,3.0,positive,positive

1826,A3VBDOG1R3GPKW,B00032KC30,"I have two cars, both of which require the large #14 sheet metal self-tapping screws to mount the plate to the nylon retainers behind the plate (the ones mounted on the car that the screws screw into). Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4"" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape.

I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal.

1888,AN81JUYW2SL24,B00062YZZS,"Mobil 1 V-Twin 20W-50I was skeptical about using this oil in my Ducati 696 at first, because the manual had specified 15W-50 and many other riders wanted me to use a 10W-40 instead. Many of them claimed that the 20W-50 was designed for slow revving Harley-Davidsons with true V-Twins instead of the somewhat higher revving L-Twins from Ducati.I had clutch slippage with Rotella T6 5W-40, so I tried the M1 V-Twin 20W-50 because it is the only over the counter synthetic xW-50 JASO MA-compliant oil I can find outside the realm of boutique Motorcycle-specific oils from Motul or Silkolene at nearly double the price.The V-Twin 20W-50 is fairly thick out of the bottle, and my 696's engine starts up with a slow lumbering attitude and sound. I contacted Mobil to make sure they would recommend it, and they stated that the V-Twin 20W-50 was the correct oil to use in my 696. Once on the road, I didn't hear/feel anything wrong. WOT 9000 RPM upshifts were clean and precise. The datalogs I got from my Ducati Data Acquisition did not show any RPM spikes, and I did not hear the cat-like screeches after an upshift.As for the high-revving engine comment earlier, I looked up Buell's 1125 and Aprilia's RSV4 engine oil requirements. They both called for 15W-50, and Amsoil's catalog showed recommendations for 20W-50. The 1125 and RSV4 are by no means low revving engines, they can rev higher than most of Ducati's engines which are already fairly high at 9k-11k RPM.Overall: 5/5 stars, great oil to use if your bike needs 15W-50.",Auto,2012-03-24,5,positive,mobil vtwin 20w50i skeptical using oil ducati first manual specified 15w many riders wanted 10w instead many claimed 20w designed slow revving harleydavidsons true vtwins instead somewhat higher revving ltwins ducatii clutch slippage rotella t6 5w tried m1 vtwin 20w counter synthetic xw jaso macompliant oil find outside realm boutique motorcyclespecific oils motul silkolene nearly double pricethe vtwin 20w fairly thick bottle engine starts slow lumbering attitude sound contacted mobil make sure would recommend stated vtwin 20w correct oil road didnt hearfeel anything wrong wot rpm upshifts clean precise datalogs got ducati data acquisition not show rpm spikes not hear catlike screeches upshiftas highrevving engine comment earlier looked buells aprilias rsv4 engine oil requirements called 15w amsoils catalog showed recommendations 20w rsv4 no means low revving engines rev higher ducatis engines already fairly high 9k11k rpmoverall stars great oil bike needs 15w,0.13460317460317459,positive,4.0,positive,positive

1901,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00062ZIRC,"My experience with Slime has been limited to bicycle tires, where the product does a good job sealing up pinhole and other small punctures in the tire tube.  I have never used Slime in an automobile tire, but since the materials are basically the same, I would assume that the product would work in a similar way.For an automobile, where the flat occurs makes a big difference.  If your car is parked and notice your tire is flat, this kit would probably be quite useful.  You can at least use the compressor to pump up the tire and check how bad the leak is.  If it is a fast leak, you can try using the Slime and see if it takes care of the problem.  The car does not need to be jacked up to use the product.If the puncture happens when the car is being driven, the problem is more serious.  When you drive on tire that is significantly deflated or flat, most times you will do heavy duty damage, or tear the tire.  If that happens, Slime won't help.  The tire will need to be replaced.  The instructions state that Slime will not work on punctures greater than 1/4 inch.  So basically, Slime is intended to address only minor tire damage.The Smart Spair kit is a pretty good deal.  It consists of a 16 ounce bottle of slime, and a compressor which plugs into the lighter outlet.  According to the label, a 16 ounce bottle, should be adequate to treat one averaged sized tire.  The 16 ounce bottle is available at Amazon for about nine dollars.  Subtract this cost from the price of the kit, and you are getting the compressor for less than fifteen dollars, which is not a bad deal.  The compressor has a pressure valve, ten foot cord, and on/off switch.  It is pretty noisy, and seems to have a reasonably quick pump rate.  It is rated for use on a minimum 15 amp circuit.  Some older cars have lighter circuits rated at only 8 amps, so you may want to check this before you buy.Hopefully I will not have to use the Smart Spair.  Based on the good (though limited) experience I have with Slime, I thought it would be good to have around, just in case.  There are many situations, where changing a tire at the side of the road, can be hazardous.  A kit like this could be valuable to those that are not capable of, jacking up their vehicle and changing the tire.

I am toying with the idea of using Carbon Zymol but it seems very expensive at $50 - $70. I have used this Turtle Wax product on our 2 year old Black Nissan Altima. I love the shiny jet black color, but it is a very unforgiving paint color, as every single chip, scratch, swirl, defect will show, not to mention water spots right after rinsing the car, prior to drying it off. The only thing that I can do is to take it to the car wash and let them wash it so that there are no spots. Our water is just too hard to wash it at home unless you have a white car or silver. Take it home after the wash and clay bar the sucker (Meguiars makes the best clay bar kit). Then you can use their ultimate compound to make it even smoother or visa-versa. If you do use the Ultimate compound be prepared that it will remove any old wax or dye that may be hiding the small scratches. Then you can use a nice car wax.

This product has no solvent, and the cleaner is an additive that cleans similar to what calcium does for engine oil.  Whether or not you ""feel"" a difference has nothing to do with your cylinders needing this lube to protect your engine.  I actually do feel a difference sometimes in various vehicles, and also I have not felt a difference in others.  Some day your engine will be burnt out and you will have wished that you used an upper cylinder lube.  Gas has a natural oil lubrication, ethanol does not, and that is why you need to add extra lubricating oil to it.  26 bucks a gallon with free shipping is a no brainier, a gallon lasts me over a year.  I buy a small 4 ounce version from the auto parts store and use that to refill with my gallon.  The gallon gives you 32 gas tanks worth of treatment.I actually don't like Lucas's product line.  Their oil products are junk if you ask me.  But this product is the real deal, and whether or not you buy Lucas or another Upper Cylinder Lube, your engine needs these types of products to minimize the damage that ethanol is currently doing to it.  Use a cleaner like Techron once every 4 tanks and use a lube in every tank.  I've seen newer engines with 25k miles on them that look like burnt out engines that are 40 years old.

1937,AYC0EKXYI2T8K,B00063X7KG,"If you have not used a clay bar, I can tell you that it really does work and it is extremely easy to use. Do not be afraid to complete a few extra passes with it. This is actually step 3 out of 4 steps. The first is to wash your car, then polish it, then clay bar the car, then use Megiuars Tech 2.0 polymer sealer. The clay bar step is actually effortless. You just have to remember not to drop the clay, and do extra passes/wipes, a small section (12&#34; x 12&#34;) at a time. The last few passes with the clay bar you can use the weight of the clay itself. One reviewer wrote that this was too mild and it did not remove a lot of contaminants. This is because he may be missing the &#34;polishing step&#34;. The &#34;contaminants&#34; should come off with the washing and polishing. The clay bar is for removing fine contaminants. Your paint will be very smooth and silky. That is no joke either; it really feels smooth. The car will then be ready for a polymer-sealant or a wax if you prefer.In Summary: Step 1 Wash your car with Megiuars Gold Class (better than the stinky yellow hazy Meguiars Ultimate Wash). Step 2 - Polish it with either of the following depending on the contaminants. Feel the paint. Is there a lot of grittiness ? Then you may want to use Megiuars medium/fine cut cleaner. The medium cut cleaner will remove some heavy duty water spots that you just cannot get out with anything else. If you do use the &#34;medium cut cleaner&#34;, then you may want to use a &#34;swirl remover&#34; after this step. If your paint feels all right (a small amount of grittiness), then a normal &#34;polish&#34; (Megiuars Ultimate Compound is great) will work just fine. Helpful hint. Purchase an inexpensive sponge, not a real loop sponge, one of those large smooth cheapy sponges for $1.75. If you use a round hand applicator, you may obtain a zebra stripe pattern. The zebra pattern means that the product is working, but your fingers are smashing down more than the applicator portion in between your fingers. You need an even pressure and your large cheapy sponge will achieve that. I also tried a large circular sponge applicator for my drill and that actually worked very well and it saved my arm a bit too. The circular applicator for my drill achieved the best results. I had major hard water spot damage that I just could not get out. Always remember that even though the paint appears very good after this step has been completed, do not stop at this step. There is no protection and your paint needs it since you just removed the protection. Step 3 - Clay Bar your car - use this kit or &#34;Mothers&#34;, although since I am writing a review in Megiuars product, use it. It works very well. Follow the directions. Use medium to light pressure. The last pass can be the weight of your clay and hand. I usually use 10-12 passes. Do not be afraid to make extra passes. The clay is really non-abrasive, and almost effortless to use. Complete the entire car. Do not drop the clay. If you do drop it there may be some grit hiding in the clay and you will scratch the heck out of your paint. I have used it after I dropped it, but it is a hassle removing the top layer of the clay that dropped. Step 4 - Waxing time - There are many many decisions to be made on this step. The different types of wax and sealants, paste wax, liquid wax will confuse even the most experienced car enthusiast. Do you enjoy waxing your vehicle every other week or once a month ? Then a very good quality Carnuba wax will work for you. Do you want the shine to last for 90 days or so ? The poly-sealant is right for you. Do you want to use a &#34;paste wax&#34; and enjoy a good workout for your biceps and triceps? Then a good paste wax is good for you. For me I want the shine to last for 90 days with minimal amount of effort to apply and remove. This is why I use Megiuars Tech 2.0 Wax which is technically not a wax at all, it is a synthetic polymer that shines very well. It will also last about 3 times longer than the carnuba wax and it is very easy to apply and remove. If you absolutely hate waxing your car and you do not mind the wonderful chemical smell, the once a year Nu Finish is actually a very good deal. It may not last a full year, but i tell you what, it is really close to it. I have used it and it works very well. It is also about $7 - $8 a can.

I've been washing and waxing my cars for 20 years, usually using a 3-step system (cleaner, polish, wax), and I usually get pretty decent results.  But I've heard so much about claying, I had to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.On my 2006 Honda Pilot with 100K+ miles, I washed and clayed first and was amazed at how much smoother the paint was.  I then tested a panel with Meguairs' Ultimate Cleaning Compound, and it did make an improvement, so I ""cleaned"" the car, then polished (Ultimate Polish) and waxed (Ultimate Wax), using an orbital polisher.  It took a few hours, but the results are astounding.  The paint is literally (not figuratively) smooth as glass.  I don't think it even felt like this when it was brand new.  The mirror finish is incredible.So if you've never clayed your car before, don't hesitate.  Just be sure to use lots of the included Quick Detailer for lubricant.I found the Meguiar's kit to be very good.

1967,A1JUBRIZMO0RJV,B00063X7KG,"When I first read about claying your vehicles, several years ago, I was a bit skeptical.  It seems strange and like a lot of work for you car, but both impressions were incorrect.After washing your vehicle with a safe wash, Claying your vehicle is the next step and a vital step.  Claying removes above surface contaminants on your paint's surface: bits of overspray, tar, etc. and lots of other things you can or more likely can't even see.  After washing your car, rub your flat hand across the surface. It won't smooth as glass. Furthermore, listen!  You'll hear your hand going back and forth over the surface as it rubs against the contaminants.  This is a car that needs to be clayed and just about any car if it has never been clayed needs to be clayed.  Even a brand new car on the lot often has contaminants.  Furthermore, once clayed, it's usually recommend to do it again every 3 months to a year, depending on the environment your car is in.  Honestly, claying your vehicle doesn't take a particularly long amount of time.  I'd say it's possible to do it in just under thirty minutes.The Smooth Surface Clay Kit from the wonderful folks at Meguiar's is the perfect kit to clay your vehicle.  Again, after washing your vehicle, spray an area with the Quick Detailer, and then use the clay bar across the surface.  You can search Youtube for Meguiar's Clay kit, to see demonstrations from users, but it isn't hard to do. Do a thorough job on your vehicle, and the way your hand then moves across the surface will impress you.  I'm amazed every time.After claying, you have several options.  The clay kit includes a sample of cleaner wax, and you can certainly use that. It has some mild cleaners and some protection.  However, if you use a cleaner wax, I'd recommend waxing the car more often as it isn't quite as durable as dedicated separate products.  Once a month for example with the cleaner wax, would be good.  Or, you could use the cleaner wax for its mild below surface cleaning properties followed by a more robust wax product such as Meguiar's Gold Class or NXT 2.0, and then you could potentially be set for a few months.If you want to do even more after claying, you can use a paint cleaner from Meguiar's for below surface contaminants right after claying, and then optionally a Pure Polish after that.  You'd top all that off with a wax such as Meguiar's Gold Class, or Meguiar's NXT 2.0.Furthermore, pick up more of the Quick Detailer, and you can use it to remove light dust and contaminants to your paint on a regular basis, and you can actually find you won't have to wash your vehicle as often.Whatever you choose, regular maintenance of your car's finish will keep you smiling for years to come. Meguiar's clay kit is a great way to start because not only does it make your finish smooth as glass, but it allows whatever wax you apply to adhere more evenly and properly to the surface, providing a better shine and longer lasting protection.A great product.

2040,A1FZ1O1T4FT2BR,B00067BWBI,"I bought this dual horn kit from another outlet, but figured I'd add my review here. This was purchased for a 2012 Wrangler Unlimited. The stock horn is fairly weak and usually doesn't produce a reaction from anyone who has cut me off or drives 15 mph while chatting on their phones.The install was rather tight. I didn't remove the front grill and just worked from the top down, right above the driver-side headlight. I mounted one right to the bracket where the stock horn was, and the other was mounted in a nearby hole where a hood alarm sensor would be located. Since I don't have a remote start kit, the sensor was absent.I highly recommend that you have some type of magnetic tool to pick up dropped bolts. Unless you remove the grill, you will be dropping things. Also, the kit comes with nothing more than the two horns and 2 ground wires. I had to purchase the mounting bolts/nuts and decided that, rather than splice into the factory wiring, to make a couple of harnesses (see image). I used male blade connectors on one end of (2) 10"", 18 gauge wires, then used splice connectors to attach another 6"" wire to each of these leads. On all of the (4) remaining wire ends, I placed female blade connectors. It turned the wiring job into a simple plug-n-play operation, while utilizing the factory hot and ground.The horns are definitely louder and the dual horn tone cuts through like a champ. It does startle people all around me when I lay on it. That was the idea, so I'm really happy with it. Supposedly, they upgraded 2013 models to a dual horn.

2061,A2337VEHDVLBDR,B00068AJPM,"I recently put this through the paces on my car.First, I used it with a foam gun just to get the loose dirt off and initial impressions were very nice!  It covered the car with a nice sudsy coating (not SUPER sudsy, but more than a budget car wash liquid) and smelled like bubble gum!  However, the suds disappeared quickly, almost TOO quickly.  Made me a bit worried.  But I moved on to the hand wash.Poured some in a bucket, filled it up with water, and as expected, LOTS of suds, but they seemed to die down very quickly... After the rinsing off the soap and drying the car though, this is where the car wash liquid REALLY shines (bad puns are bad).In the sun, the paint was deep, reflective, and it just looked CONSIDERABLY cleaner than before.  It looked like a whole new depth was added to the paint.  Coming fromMeguiar's Wash and Wax - 48 oz., this car wash liquid takes the cake in final finish and cleaning ability.  However, I think the Meguiar's takes the trophy home for best smelling (to me), most suds, and longest lasting suds.  The Mothers left an awesome finish and kept water spots away when drying, but the bubblegum smell was nearly non-existent and the suds were worrying at first.I would consider Mothers California Gold as a nice start to a full-on DIY detailing job (or even just a quick, light detailing job).  It gives a nice base to work off of.  It seems to clean dirt off more effectively than Meguiar's (tested by clay bar) and leaves a nice, smooth finish, giving you a bit more peace-of-mind.However, if you are short on time and would rather just give it a quick wash, consider the Meguiar's.  It'll give you a one-two combo of a wash that's ever so slightly less shiny and will coat it with a (very) light wax.Sum:- Good: Smells like bubble gum, leaves a deep finish (whole new depth - especially on darker colors!), keeps water spots from forming while drying, cleaning ability is awesome!- Not-So-Good: Suds are a bit disappointing, scent isn't as defined or noticeable once rinsed off.Recommended!",Auto,2012-06-27,4,positive,recently put paces carfirst foam gun get loose dirt initial impressions nice covered car nice sudsy coating not super sudsy but budget car wash liquid smelled bubble gum however suds disappeared quickly almost quickly made bit worried but moved hand washpoured bucket filled water expected lots suds but seemed die quickly rinsing soap drying car though car wash liquid really shines bad puns badin sun paint deep reflective looked considerably cleaner looked whole new depth added paint coming frommeguiars wash wax oz car wash liquid takes cake final finish cleaning ability however think meguiars takes trophy home best smelling suds longest lasting suds mothers left awesome finish kept water spots away drying but bubblegum smell nearly nonexistent suds worrying firsti would consider mothers california gold nice start fullon diy detailing job even quick light detailing job gives nice base work seems clean dirt effectively meguiars tested clay bar leaves nice smooth finish giving bit peaceofmindhowever short time would rather give quick wash consider meguiars itll give onetwo combo wash thats ever slightly less shiny coat light waxsum good smells bubble gum leaves deep finish whole new depth especially darker colors keeps water spots forming drying cleaning ability awesome notsogood suds bit disappointing scent isnt defined noticeable rinsed offrecommended,0.21850707432102778,positive,23.0,positive,positive

For that, I use Mothers Mag & Aluminum Polish.  It works great, and it leaves my aluminum wheels looking shiny and like new.I normally use one of my husband's old (white) athletic socks to apply it - by wearing it on my hand like a sock puppet.

It removes any remaining road grime, brake dust - and water stains, which are sometimes the hardest to clean - fully restoring the finish to its previous luster.  The old sock ""hand puppet"" allows me to reach into every nook and cranny.  I then use a cheap microfiber wiping cloth to finish the job and remove the polish.I couldn't be happier with the results.  This isn't something I use every time I wash my car or my wheels.

2108,A38D1RKG2YKC8E,B00068XCQU,"EXPERIENCE: I have found this charger to be pretty cool! First of all, it was packaged well from Amazon.com, they like to use the air pocket material for packing, which works great, and is less messy then foam peanuts. The charger comes inside a plastic packaging case with both alligator and permanent wiring connectors. It also comes with a warrantee slip and a paper manual. The first thing I noticed was how light weight the charger is, right around 3-LBS, as opposed to my heavy 8-LBS fast charger counterpart.I really like the cables the charger comes with, the alligator clip ends are made of actual copper, which as you know, allow for better conductivity, which is why copper is used on computer heat sinks to dissipate heat. This particular wire also includes an 7.5-AMP inline fuse, with a cover over it to keep water out. At the other end of the wire uses a proprietary connector system, so that you can disconnect it from the charger incase of emergency, without the need to unplug the charger!The permanent style wire, uses your typical battery bolt type connectors, which allow you to permanently install the charger, for year round use. This also uses a 7.5-AMP inline fuse, and also uses the proprietary connector at the other end. All I had to do to hook it up was, connect the alligators to the battery, connect the other end to the charger output wire, and then plug in the power, that simple!The first thing I saw was a steady ""RED"" light, to indicate that the charger was charging the battery. However, since my battery was at 12-volts at the get go, it didn't take long for the charger to start flashing the ""GREEN"" light, which indicates battery at 80% charged. Remember, a fully charged battery will actually show 13.5 to 14.5 volts. So, it took a while, charging at a 1.2-AMP interval, to get my battery there.TIP: With a lot of modern day vehicles, they have onboard systems which have a low power draw off the battery at all times while the vehicle is sitting. This is unfortunate, as the charger only charges at a 1.2-AMP interval, any onboard systems sucking that amount, will keep the charger from charging your battery. In this particular case, it is best to disconnect your battery from your vehicle.Once my battery was charged, it went into float mode. You know when its in float mode, when the ""RED"" light goes off and the ""GREEN"" light stays on steady. At this point of time, it is not putting a charge on my battery. But it will wait till it drops due to the freezing temperature, and then it will kick back on till its charged again. Think of it like the furnace in your home, the heater comes on when the temperature falls, and turns off when the temperature reaches your set temp setting.CONCLUSION: My fast charger would always be very warm when I used it, but the BTPLUS is only luke warm, you hardly even notice it! My fast charger also emitted a noticeable loud humming sound, my BTPLUS emits a sound so quiet, that you have to put your ear up to the charger to hear it! My fast charger has the ability to cook a battery and destroy it, where as the BTPLUS will maintain my battery and make it last a long time. Sometimes people think that speed is everything, I say no, cause when it comes to batteries, slower is better. The way I look at it is, this is an awesome charger, and I recommend it with 5-stars!",Auto,2010-11-06,5,positive,experience found charger pretty cool first packaged well amazoncom air pocket material packing works great less messy foam peanuts charger comes inside plastic packaging case alligator permanent wiring connectors also comes warrantee slip paper manual first thing noticed light weight charger right around lbs opposed heavy lbs fast charger counterparti really cables charger comes alligator clip ends made actual copper know allow better conductivity copper computer heat sinks dissipate heat particular wire also includes amp inline fuse cover keep water end wire uses proprietary connector system disconnect charger incase emergency without need unplug chargerthe permanent style wire uses typical battery bolt type connectors allow permanently install charger year round also uses amp inline fuse also uses proprietary connector end hook connect alligators battery connect end charger output wire plug power simplethe first thing saw steady red light indicate charger charging battery however since battery volts get go didnt take long charger start flashing green light indicates battery charged remember fully charged battery actually show volts took charging amp interval get battery theretip lot modern day vehicles onboard systems low power draw battery times vehicle sitting unfortunate charger charges amp interval onboard systems sucking amount keep charger charging battery particular case best disconnect battery vehicleonce battery charged went float mode know float mode red light goes green light stays steady point time not putting charge battery but wait till drops due freezing temperature kick back till charged think furnace home heater comes temperature falls turns temperature reaches temp settingconclusion fast charger would always warm but btplus luke warm hardly even notice fast charger also emitted noticeable loud humming sound btplus emits sound quiet put ear charger hear fast charger ability cook battery destroy btplus maintain battery make last long time sometimes people think speed everything say no cause comes batteries slower better way look awesome charger recommend stars,0.1651392632524708,positive,6.0,positive,positive

However I spent up for this for my prize motorcycle . I have it plugged into a battery backup for tv equipment . It stopped working and has a burning smell into it . Customer Service said they would replace it if I sent it in . It is 7 months old but was only put in service for the past week as I had so many others . Thbey scared me saying they often find user error . What could I have done ? I couldn't treat it better . Because it is under a year they said to send in in at my expense and the turnaround is 7- 10 days if they don't determine user error . That's scarey .I still find trusting people is best and I will take the time and expense to send it in though many companies just replace things . I can see why they do not this isn't a cheap piece of equipment . I was very happy for the 7 months ( week it worked ) and I love their quick disconnect plug , sadly I may have lost my battery as it could of broke anytime since it was put in service . I know it was working when first hooked up  . Because I value my equipment so much I am going trust this was a fluke and  buy a extra one to have as I am disabled and these save batteries on vehicles that rarely are driven . I am a little disappointed I had a failure so quick again it was in the first week of use after I stored my purchase since Jan 2013  . Failures was the reason I stopped using the Harbor Freight $6 on sale ones but their so cheap I keep a half a dozen at the house and with any hint of a problem put a new one on . I use these devices on several items and would have to replace about 2 harbor freight ones each year .  Also  with theirs you do not have that nice disconnect that is so great on snowmobiles , mopeds , or motorcycles . I would even like to have one on the cars and may as they can fit the accessory connectors  .  I did expect this to be much more trustworthy but will give it one more chance before I give up . Though at up to $69 retail that's a lot of money to loose for burning up a few penny capacitor if Lorreta at Deltran is correct . She said they will go poof if their is any fluctuation in voltage . Nothing else on that circuit or any others had issues at all . It was just placed in service . I will update after sending in . They did not require it verbally when calling in but I will pay the extra money to have it signed for . It helps since it is the first year not to have to pay the $8 inspection fee . You can smell it is burnt . Frustrating , I hate electronic devices because they do often have such high failure rates .Note : it took three weeks and I had to be home to sign for the one sent back which caused me to spend a whole day watching for Fedx but they replaced the bad unit . I had a surge suppressor on the other one and have since upgraded it to another Monster unit that was a daily deal . I also have gone with a 14 kw Kohler generator with a whole whose surge protector .

2125,A1Z7PH9LKWUUQ,B00068XCQU,"So, I have both a Battery Tender Plus and a Junior.  They're great devices; I've brought batteries seemingly back from the dead with them when some other chargers I had could not.  However, there are two points worth making:The Junior and Plus have the same logic; they only differ in the maximum charging current.  Basically, the Plus will charge a battery up faster.  If you're only using them for storage or you're not in a hurry, save nearly $20 and get the Junior.  But I expect that you'll be happy with either one.The one complaint I have is with the Warranty.  My Plus stopped working recently.  I'm not sure why; perhaps a power surge or something; it's not like I've ever dropped or abused it.  In any event, since they have a 10 year warranty, I called Deltran up.  I can send the unit in (which will cost me $8+ for shipping with some kind of tracking so I can verify that it arrived) and then they charge $17 and change for a ""warranty diagnosic"" and return shipping.  So, it basically costs around $25 to get my $40 device serviced under warranty.  It's not a completely unreasonable sum, but if Deltran really had faith in their products, they could easily eat that cost - I think I should at least not have to pay for a diagnostic fee on something under warranty which I've already proven to not work in multiple outlets and on multiple batteries. I think I'll just pay the extra $15 to get a brand new one, and use this as a paper weight.But anyway, the products work really well.  My advice is just to buy this assuming there's really no warranty; as long as that's your expectation, you won't be disappointed.",Auto,2010-11-29,4,positive,battery tender plus junior theyre great devices ive brought batteries seemingly back dead chargers could not however two points worth makingthe junior plus logic differ maximum charging current basically plus charge battery faster youre using storage youre not hurry save nearly get junior but expect youll happy either onethe one complaint warranty plus stopped working recently im not sure perhaps power surge something not ive ever dropped abused event since year warranty called deltran send unit cost shipping kind tracking verify charge change warranty diagnosic return shipping basically costs around get device serviced warranty not completely unreasonable sum but deltran really faith products could easily eat cost think least not pay diagnostic fee something warranty ive already proven not work multiple outlets multiple batteries think ill pay extra get brand new one paper weightbut anyway products work really well advice assuming theres really no warranty long thats expectation wont disappointed,0.04650856389986825,negative,-2.0,negative,positive

2141,A3TA1UJWRJF9NC,B00068XCQU,"I got this because my battery kept dying on me.  I think I found the source of the problem after I ordered it but this thing will make sure my battery is kept at full charge.  It comes with 0-ring terminals and alligator clips.  The alligator clips are very easy to put on the terminals.  I read somewhere that the 0-rings are for motorcycles and lawn mowers and stuff so I will just keep them for that.  Anyways, I used regular jumper cables to give my battery enough juice to start my car.  No where in the instructions does it say if the vehicle should be on or off while charging.  My best guess was off since it takes almost 2 days for a complete charge and who leaves their car on for that long, and plus you can charge it with the battery out of the car.  So anyways, I made that little charge for my battery to get up and running and disconnected the jumper cables.  This next part is very important.  First you should connect the alligator cables to the quick connect ends on the battery charger.  Then put the alligator clips on the car positive/negetive leads.  Then if you used an extension cord like I did, plug that into a socket.  Now line up the charger end with the extension cord end.  Make sure all your connections are well on, and then connect the extension cord to the battery charger.  If all goes well, like it did with mine, the red light should come on and say Charging.  I read somewhere that if both the green/red lights STAY on, that your battery is completely dead and that you should disconnect the battery right away or it could lead to bad damage.  The red/green lights flash at startup but then it turned to red.  So anyways, now I am waiting for the complete charge to fill up my battery.  It is 3pm now on a Thursday and I will fill in this space with when it completed.  Keep in mind the instructions say to keep this charger as far away from the battery as possible while charging.  I have mine on the ground right in front of the car so that should work just fine.  I wouldn't recommend putting it inside the engine anywhere like the instructions say.  All in all, for the money of this thing, it is definately worth having around.  I wish I knew about this when I had my motorcycle, because that thing died on me every other day and the quick connect on this would have made charging that thing a breeze.  Also with a riding mower that won't start.  I might get a socket end for the cord so it can charge while in the car.  Other people have said this in their reviews and I will see what it's all about.  Good luck charging!Edit:  So the cigarette adapter just makes hooking it up easier, but it still needs to be connected to a DC outlet so I will pass on that.  Also, I found out that the unit gets very very hot.  I had it on for like 4 hours and touched it and it almost burned me.  Being close to 90 degrees outside couldn't have helped much either, but just be careful.Edit:  So my battery is fully charged now.  It took about a day to charge the whole thing.

It has been doing a great job keeping the battery on it charged up through some especially cold weather we've had. So after @3years of use, I still give it 5-stars. Awesome product!Update 11/19/12: I noticed something really smelling in my garage, and spent quite a while trying to find it. It was a horrible ""ozone"" like smell, but clearly was the smell of burning electronics. When I got to my Battery Tender, I noticed the light was no longer on and it smelled really bad, so I immediately unplugged it. I'm not quite sure what happened, but am a little concerned about this. That said, I will consider replacing it as I still believe it's a good product.Update 02/19/13: As these units carry a 10-year limited warranty (if you have your receipt), I decided to send it in. The cost of mailing it was around $9 for standard post, and $11 for Priority Mail. The warranty replacement charge is $12.95 (why not just $13?). So in total, it will cost me just under $25. That is, assuming they replace it, which I certainly hope they will! I will post follow-up later.Update 03/20/13: It took approximately 2 weeks, but Deltran DID replace my charger under warranty. The thing is, the replacement charger - which appears to be brand new, and not refurbished - did not come with ANY paperwork. No ""we're sorry for your inconvenience"" letter, no receipt, no packing slip... nothing. So my warranty on the replacement will only be as good as the remainder of what I had left on my original 10 years (approx 4 years). The inconvenience of the return was frustrating, and I'd have liked at least an acknowledgement of that from Deltran, but it ""is what it is"". Hopefully this new one holds up at least as long as the first.",Auto,2008-07-09,5,positive,ford truck quite drain battery times especially colder months purchased last winter never issue battery low cold despite pretty frigid temps shelf front truck leave lead charger hanging wired battery end battery channeled plug end pulled grill nearly invisible not but quick easy plug ive gotten plugging truck every time im done little puppy brings full charge fairly quicklyhighly recommended especially older car either doesnt get driven much heavy drain batteryupdate unfortunately sold truck back late summer however little battery tender still going strong immediately hooked wheeler great job keeping battery charged especially cold weather weve 3years still give stars awesome productupdate noticed something really smelling garage spent quite trying find horrible ozone smell but clearly smell burning electronics got battery tender noticed light no longer smelled really bad immediately unplugged im not quite sure happened but little concerned said consider replacing still believe good productupdate units carry year limited warranty receipt decided send cost mailing around standard post priority mail warranty replacement charge not total cost assuming replace certainly hope post followup laterupdate took approximately weeks but deltran replace charger warranty thing replacement charger appears brand new not refurbished not come paperwork no sorry inconvenience letter no receipt no packing slip nothing warranty replacement good remainder left original years approx years inconvenience return frustrating id liked least acknowledgement deltran but hopefully new one holds least long first,0.03982120310245311,negative,5.0,positive,positive
2152,A91BVZEDZYEWW,B00068XCQU,"I have been using a Battery Tender Junior for about 5 years on my motorcycle.  I always plug in the bike and it works great.I recently purchased the Battery Tender Plus to use on my Duramax truck (2 batteries).  It seems to work great so far.  I expect long life of the unit and the batteries just as I have in the past using this line of Battery Tenders.I give it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of the short length of cable they give you.  The Junior's cables are so long that I can run that thing clear across the room.  The Plus' cables are so short that I had to splice in more cable.  They apparently don't expect you to charge your batteries in-vehicle with the Plus.By the way, the Plus brings my 2 very large batteries in my truck upto full charge in less than 8 hours.  They are new batteries and the truck's charging system works just fine and the truck is even driven almost everyday.  However, there is alot of parasitic draw on the batteries with the remote start / alarm system on overnite.  Combined with the 100 plus degree heat of the desert, the Battery Tender Plus is warranted.Of course I would not expect it to recharge my truck batteries if they were dead.  It is not designed to.  Make sure you look at the specs and know what you need.  I just needed a battery tender - something that would keep my batteries at full charge or restore the bit of charge lost overnite from the parasitic draw of the car alarm / starter.  By spec, the Battery Tender Plus cannot recharge these large batteries from dead.  Again, know what you need.

It charged the battery in about 24 hours, the battery was a full size 12v car battery. I believe the manual said it should have taken around 18 hours. Either way, for getting a battery maintaining and charging device for this price I have been very happy with the product.

Then the warranty card states that if any repairs need to be made, the company will notify you of the cost. Sounds like some sort of a screwy scam to me, but if this unit ever fails (hopefully in many years to come) I will simply purchase another one because I am sure it would cost you about $5-10 to ship the unit back to the manufacturer, then you need to include your $16 fee and then pay for any repairs.

Even if your older filter is only getting half of the minerals, that's half of as much going into the fresh filter. When you eventually start to see more spots than the norm, take the oldest filter off and add your new filter after the flow of the filter that's been there. I hope you got my explanation.

2372,A2VXI950XOB9Q,B0006JLW34,"I bought this valve with high hopes of simplifying the regular draining of our 6-gal Atwood RV water heater, as removal of the standard nylon plug is a pain due to its location.  If you are looking to purchase this product under the same pretense, let me save you the time -- in my case, the better part of an afternoon.First, a quick explanation of how the valve works -- there are actually three components at play: 1) the large diameter plug that screws into the water heater, 2) a secondary plug that screws into the first, and 3) the actual valve which you open and close to drain the water.  I believe the intent of this design is to allow &#34;regular&#34; draining of the water heater with the last/smallest valve, while removal of the medium nut could be used perhaps at the end of the season to allow more sediment and debris to exit the tank quickly (due to the larger diameter).  Sidenote: opening the actual valve (the smallest component) drains the tank very, very slowly, and sometimes only at a trickle if you can't get air behind the water -- in my case, I had to open the pressure relief valve (in addition to all faucets) to produce an acceptable drain rate.While the valve piece never had any issues with leaking, the other components did.  I tried screwing in these nuts with and without Teflon tape, and at various depths.  No matter what the combination, there was always a small leak coming from either of these pieces.  There appeared to be no way to practically stop the leaking.  I also tried wrapping the nuts with an excess of Teflon tape (5+ wraps), to no avail.I gave up after about 2-3 hours of tinkering, returned the valve to Amazon, and ended up sticking with the standard nylon plug.

2451,A38D1RKG2YKC8E,B0006O1ICE,"EXPERIENCE: JB Weld is made up of two parts, 1-parts liquid steel and 1-parts hardener. Like most strong epoxy's, you have to combined the two for the product to work. They recommend you use a clean disposable container, I used a sour cream container which I washed first.The first thing you are going to want to do before you make a JB Weld mix, is to prep the surface before application. They recommend you use Acetone or paint thinner to clean the surface, as it will not leave a petroleum film, since I didn't have any of either, I used carburetor/choke cleaner.Since the surface's were already rough, I didn't have to rough them up. However, keep in mind, if you are planning to apply JB Weld to a smooth surface, you should also rough up the surface using a fine grit sand paper as a second preparation step. I began applying JB Weld, with my cheap $1.00 painters brush from the dollar store. I applied the thick compound evenly over the entire area which meshed with the rim.Then using a piece of wood on one side of the rim, and a C-clamp, I clamped the piece on the rim with pressure and left it there for over 24-hours. After 24-hours, the JB Weld was cured and I removed the C-clamp to reveal a very strong bond! I tried to move the piece back and fourth, but it wouldn't budge, its welded like it should be!The nice thing about JB Weld, is that it can be sanded, ground down, painted, after it has been cured. I noticed JB Weld had blooped out the edges after I installed the piece. So using a dremel with a deburring tool, I managed to grind it down flush with the rim.I also used this product to seal a gas leak in the tillers carburetor bowl. It actually did as advertised and sealed the leak, there is no gas leaking out of the carb now!CONCLUSION: While I would not have believed this product could actually weld metal together, I am now a believer. If you don't own a welders kit, or have any welding knowledge, JB Weld, in my opinion, is the best product to get you out of a jam.

2469,AI0BCEWRE04G0,B0006O1ICE,"WHEN TO USE EPOXY CEMENTWhen you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable and/or paintable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is usually the best choice.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.WHEN TO USE JB-WELDJB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements/glues are usually better choices.  Some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name ""weld"" is inappropriate---to some extent that's true.  JB Weld can do some jobs welding can't.  Conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with JB Weld.HOW TO USE JB-WELDGeneral Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 RollJoining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1/8"" steel rod, to another 1/8"" steel rod, forming a ""T"" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1""-long ""L's"" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the ""L""s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges. You may have to apply several layers of the JB Weld-saturated fiberglass cloth. Sometimes wire cloth (window screening) can be used.Holes in car body panels etc:  If you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal (held in place by JB Weld) that is a good strategy---the combination of pop-rivets and JB Weld often works especially well, even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away.TEKTON 6555 Rivet Gun with 40-pc. RivetsMixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not ""dry""--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and ""take it easy"" for a couple of days.WHEN TO USE OTHER EPOXIESFor materials other than metal, particularly for rigid plastics, other epoxies are usually better than JB Weld.  Some epoxies are clear, or white, or specialized for particular purposes.  For exampleCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozWHEN TO USE QUICK-EPOXIESOrdinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.WHEN TO USE OTHER CEMENTS OR GLUESWhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5/8 oz. (E379)Glue Stick: Think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form.  Glue sticks are great with paper, but have few other applications.Avery Glue Stic, 0.26 oz, Pack of 6, (98095)Wood Glue: Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue. It is safe, and cleanup is easy. If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued. For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceGoop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a ""cushioned"" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength. For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozFabric Glue:Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics, saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond, but without soaking through.  Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per PackLiquid Nails/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.  For small projects, Goop is usually a better choice.Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job.",Auto,2012-03-28,5,positive,epoxy cementwhen need strong rigid workable eg sandable andor paintable surface adhesive particularly metal hard plastic epoxy usually best choice epoxies dry little

2476,A2R02EPJS5O7QP,B0006ODWE6,"As everyone else points out, this intake tube will make your engine sound louder during moderate to heavy acceleration, but that is simply because it eliminates the factory resonance chamber.  The minimum cross section is the same as your stock tube so its not capable of flowing any more air than stock.  It still has the sharp 90 degree turn to the throttle body that the OEM system has.  There may be some minor reduction of turbulance, but at most engine speeds, especially where the engine spends most of its time, it won't matter.  I've never seen an independent  dyno test published with a before and after with just this mod.  Clearly the postings on Airaid's site are BS.  If something this simple could increase HP and torque by 5% across the RPM band, it would be incorporated into your car from the factory.  I doubt there is any HP improvement but there might be 1 or 2 HP gain.  Not enough to feel and not enough to measure with a G-tech on 1/8 mile runs.  On my 5.3 there was zero improvement in mileage over 40K miles of driving compared to before.  This includes some 400 mile runs pulling a 6000lb trailer.  It does look better than the stock set up and it really makes your motor sound like it has more power.  If that does it for you, buy one - its well made and fits great.  If you want a few more HP, save your money for a DiabloSport Predator or similar.  Only negative with the tube is you need to loosen the clamp at the throttle body to service your stock air filter because the coupling is not as flexible as the original (it doesnt need to be).",Auto,2012-06-29,3,positive,everyone else points intake tube make engine sound louder moderate heavy acceleration but simply eliminates factory resonance chamber minimum cross section stock tube not capable flowing air stock still sharp degree turn throttle body oem system may minor reduction turbulance but engine speeds especially engine spends time wont matter ive never seen independent dyno test published mod clearly postings airaids site bs something simple could increase hp torque across rpm band would incorporated car factory doubt hp improvement but might hp gain not enough feel not enough measure gtech mile runs zero improvement mileage 40k miles driving compared includes mile runs pulling 6000lb trailer look better stock really makes motor sound power one well made fits great want hp save money diablosport predator similar negative tube need loosen clamp throttle body service stock air filter coupling not flexible original doesnt need,0.1,positive,15.0,positive,positive

Removes a lot of extra tubing that doesn't need to be their. When installing, put the metal clamp things on first, then the rubber tube. Fit the rubber tube over the fittings (Air box or the Intake itself) then put the metal clamps over the rubber tubes that connect the Intake tube to the rest of the motor/air box.
