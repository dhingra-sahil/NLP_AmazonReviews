I have tried very hard to tread through the writing and learn something useful but chapter after chapter seems to be the exact same thing... overly wordy, rambling & unnecessarily academic writing with no comprehensible message behind it, no strategies I can apply to my own business and no organization that I can make sense of. Feels almost like I'm reading a paper a college student BSed their way through with a whole bunch of long words and cryptic sentences in order to sound impressive. What a rip-off. I paid $70 for this and it has been the most useless book I've paid for in my research process (and I've read 16 other books thus far to help me with my venture).

The only reason I'm giving this two stars and not one star is that out of the first six chapters I've read, two of them actually made sense. One was on International Marketing and did a very good job explaining the technology limitations of other countries and the ways foreign citizens adapt to this and use technology. This is actually very helpful information and I'm going to use it. The second was on the legal and ethical aspects of using the internet.

13,A1M4P30L5OACAI,0132147556,"This book served as the textbook for the first of a 3-course series on internet marketing for my MBA course.  While it was acceptable as a textbook - a broad survey of E-commerce for academic use - it would not be worth the considerable cost for someone who did not need it for a course.

For an academic course, the book serves as a base by providing definitions and explanations for a broad range of topics.  In my course, the book was used to introduce a number of topics that were discussed in further detail during class discussions, and it was supplemented by case studies, videos, and articles with more depth.  A non-academic reader would not have those enrichment elements available, thus would likely find the book less useful.

The book does not explain how to do anything (set up an online store, write a blog article, configure analytics, etc.).  It is a decent text for someone looking for a broad view of e-commerce with emphasis on defining terms and covering the big picture.

More importantly this book regularly cites wikipedia as a source, and I caught at least two examples of incorrect information when discussing how companies fit certain profiles. In one example it states that Kit Kat is a Nestle brand when it is produced by Hershey's. It also uses companies as examples that have long since been bought out by other companies. While neither of these two items errodes the core idea of marketing, they were just easily spotted.

21,A38NELQT98S4H8,0321719816,"I've been using Dreamweaver (and it's predecessor Macromedia's UltraDev) for many years.  For someone who is an experienced web designer, this course is a high-level review of the CS5 version of Dreamweaver, but it doesn't go into a great enough level of detail to find it very useful.

On the other hand, this is a great tool for someone who is a relative novice at web design.  It starts off with a basic overview of HTML and continues through the concepts necessary to build a modern web site.  Someone who goes through this course should exit with enough knowledge to create something that does what you want it do do...within reason.  Don't expect to go off and build an entire e-commerce system with only this class under your belt.

It's important to note that there's a long gap from site design to actual implementation.  This course teaches you how to implement a design.  The user interface and overall user experience is a different subject that isn't covered here...it's possible to do a great implementation of an absolutely abysmal design.

Starts off with ""what is HTML"" and some other basic stuff. Includes topics such as: Planning your Website; Defining a site in DW; Creating a new web page; Adding Text; Formatting with CSS; Images and rich media; Links; Page layout w/ CSS; Tables; Forms; Reusable Content; Testing; etc. Each section has sub-sections with their own video, and some have sub-sub-sections to flesh out the material, such as the one regarding project management, or CSS, which includes discussion of CSS for print. It is not, however, a tutorial on ""the best way to lay out a site using CSS"" or anything like that. For that, you'll need a book or two on that subject.

She has a site that has some helpful resources, e.g. checklists for project management and site development, and helpful URLs. All in all, it's a decent introduction to creating web sites.

She sounds weird, though, like a robot (or Stephen Hawking's voicebox) with her halting, clipped delivery. She tends to be slightly chatty and repeat material, but it's not that bad; could be helpful for retention for people new to the subject.

UI - at the top of the interface, there's a ""Previous Video"" button and ""Next Video"" button. The ""Next Video"" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read ""Take Test"" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.

There's a ""Watch and Work"" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.

23,ACJT8MUC0LRF0,0321719816,"If you've been wanting to learn how to create your own website, but have either lacked the confidence or knowledge, this affordable combination book and video course will enable you to learn at your own leisure.  There are more than twelve hours of video training included in this package, most of it split up in the small, absorbable sections.  This courseware is ""Certified Associate,"" approved courseware.  Dreamweaver is the premier product for website creation.  It offers several new advantages/features for the user.  It has improved dynamic applications, new CSS features that offer more control over your design, you can turn individual CSS properties on and off (you can see how they affect your designs), and you can fuse box model elements to troubleshoot directly within Dreamweaver.  If you are confident this DVD/book bundle is for you, you can simply bypass this review or read some shorter versions (this is a very long review).  If not, keep on reading.

With this software you'll learn a lot of basics, however, if you are already a web designer or have a lot of experience, you may find a lot of the material to be redundant.  On the other hand, if you are anxious to learn web design, this is the perfect place to start.  Taking a course can cost you a lot of $, but this course is quite affordable ... if you decide it is not for you, then you can hand it along to someone else.  You'll be getting more than twelve hours of video training from ""Adobe Certified Instructors"", a reference book, lesson files, and you can copy certain files to your iPhone, iPod, or iPad.

For the hearing impaired the script to the dialogue runs along the bottom as the narrator speaks. You can stop the video at any time to get a closer look at what is being done and/or absorb the material.  At the end of each section is a ""test"" to enable you to know just how you are progressing on each section.

If you are in a bookstore you can easily pick up a copy and glance at the book, but you cannot see what is on the DVD.  I'll try to describe what is on the DVD to the buyer can get a good understanding of what is on there and can decide if Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 is what they need.

24,A2RQ0AT4XZUIXL,0321719816,"I've been working with Dreamweaver for a few years now - learning as I go. When I got a chance to request these videos, I thought I'd get a chance to learn Dreamweaver, finally, to maximize its capabilities. And I was totally blown away.

The videos are superb. The female voiceover is pleasant and very straightforward; there's no attempt at humor and no attempt to replicate a classroom course. The program uses live action sequences to walk us through specific examples, step by step. I was amazed at how many Dreamweaver features I haven't used, just because I didn't even notice they were there.

25,AYUF7YETYOLNX,0321719816,"I've been creating websites with Dreamweaver for years now, and all that experience has taught me one thing - I'm a hack web designer.  Recently I have been trying to learn industry CSS standards and had heard that Dreamweaver has made great advances in CSS management in CS4 and CS5. I'm embarrassed to say what version I am using.

When I got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set I jumped for two reasons, first I was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to DW CS5 and I second I have always that I was missing out on a lot of DW's capabilities.  It's now obvious that I should upgrade for the CSS management upgrades alone.

As for the value of the training - I couldn't be happier.  This is not an advanced tips and tricks resource, nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring, but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing.  I watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an HTML refresher then move to the meatier DW specific training.  I can see myself returning to several sections later to brush up.

Personally, the CSS, Media, and Forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag.  The training lessons were short and easily digestible.  I liked that it broke training into 3-10 minutes so I had some time to do a little more in-depth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned CSS objects (which it won't.) or checking my version of DW.

  What this is
  - An Adobe Certification Training Aid - so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire DW web creation process
  - A wonderfully designed interface
  - A great overview of using DW

What it isn't
  - A substitute for spending the time working with DW (but it will jump start a novice)
  - An expert tips and tricks reference

All in all, I highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn DW or even web design in general. The CSS placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic I have been able to find.  The author's delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best, most intuitive I have seen. The only bad thing I can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on, so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen. So sometimes I had to close it to see things the author was pointing out.

The product being reviewed here is how to use Dreamweaver - not how to design for the web. Both expect you already have the design part.

I used a pure HTML editor, which for beginners is the best way to go. You'll learn HTML and CSS along with exactly how your code changes your page. DW is more for time savings and automation. That said, it's also massively complex with a steep learning curve. And that's where Learn Adobe Dreamweaver comes in.

I had really hoped that this dvd video that is ""Adobe Approved"" would have helped, but it fell short. First off I do want to give kudos for the way the software interface is designed. They made it very easy to navigate and find specific contents and general ease. Candyce Mairs, the teacher, gives excellent explanations and speaks clearly and at a good pace. The pace isn't too fast or too slow and I never had to rewind to listen to instructions over and over.

The course begins with the absolute basics so this is where it really breaks everything down about Dreamweaver. Being I knew most of the basics, after an hour, skipped some of it because I already knew it. The first problem I have with this training video is that you are taught to design websites from 1990. The look of them is so out dated and old its a waste of time learning it this way because anyone wanting to design a web site would not want one that looks so out dated and blah. When the videos finally get around to showing the ""CSS"" style designing, they show an example of a web site that is current in design and style. Exactly what I was wanting to learn but they don't use it for the training...WHAT? are they joking? They go back to the 1990 styled site that they show you in the beginning of these videos and TRY to update and revamp it into CSS. I wanted to focus on the CSS portion because for my needs, this is the missing info that has held me back on finally learning and make a modern web site using Dreamweaver.

The sample that they should have used to teach the CSS had many bells and whistles like when you scroll thru the site the background didn't move. The background was a great illustration photo! Then there were great drop down sub nav links that all had different colors, maps, columns, video etc. Again, all the modern bells and whistles. Yes, they do teach many of these features but in the OLD 1990 style, not in the CSS which is a complete different way of putting things into the program. I really wish they used the sample which they showed about how great CSS is. TOTAL BUMMER!!!!

I find the instructors voice pleasant and thorough although I thought it took way too long to get down to business.  I didn't really feel like I was learning or doing anything until well into the lessons.  She also seemed to wander off course to much for my liking.

I also found that she didn't prep me well enough for each lesson by telling me what files I needed and setting up Dreamweaver for each lesson.  I was frequently going to the DVD's Assets folder to get files that were missing from the lessons.  Luckily I have been using Dreamweaver long enough to know how to troubleshoot and find the missing parts.  But I wonder if a beginner would get confused and not know what to do without careful lesson setup.

And I could swear there were a few mistakes on the lesson's end in the quiz answers at the end of each lesson.  Some questions were confusing.

32,A3EZEP0FX5BC1P,0321719816,"This is my honest review of the Adobe Dreamweaver Learn by Video.  The DVD comes in a standard plastic disc holder in a cardboard box, which is part of the whole box package.  It DOES NOT come with Dreamweaver CS5.

I thought it was a standard video DVD.  It is in fact a program that has to be executed (without installing anything on your computer.)  I am running it on a PC workstation.  My antivirus/spyware programs have not gone off yet, so there does not seem to be any malware associated with it.

The video contains over 12 hours of video instruction, and is accompanied by a printed guide book to teach the fundamentals of Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.  It also goes through some basic principles and fundamentals of web design.  The presenter (Candyce Mairs) is a clear and eloquent speaker, and is an Adobe Certified Instructor.  The video runs in the middle of the window, and you can select to have the sidebar available or hidden.

First few chapters are very basic.  It is intended for those who have little or no background/experience with the terminology, such as ""URL"" and ""domain name.""  Yeah, it's goes to the fundamentals.  I like the subtitle at the bottom of the video.  The first few chapters are so basic that I actually started writing this review while I the video is running on the other monitor (I have a dual-monitor setup).  The first chapter is dedicated to HTML fundamentals and also acts as a refresher for those who have the experience.  The second chapter is an introduction to what Dreamweaver is and what it can do.  Chapter 3 is a ""Quick Start"" chapter that gets the user setup with putting together a homepage (basic starter layouts, building the homepage, creating header area, etc.).  There are some tests at the end of each chapter to help reinforce what you've learned.

What I liked:
-This is a book designed for beginners.  As such, the first few chapters will be mostly overview and fundamentals.
-The DVD comes with a guide book.  It helps with the video, and it can be brought around so you can read it without the video.
-The course layout is logical, and therefore it makes sense.  I've seen so many poorly designed guides that jump all over the place, and this video guide is not one of these.
-Having the a ""video"" of what the speaker is talking about really helps.  You can follow what the screen should look like.
-The caption at the bottom of the video.  This was such a major positive.  A+++

What I did not like:
-The startup was not as straightforward as I expected.  Again, no big deal, but I can see how this could be a problem for those who do not know how to enable autostart, or those whose antivirus prevents the startup of an .exe file.
-The DVD could have came with the trial version of Dreamweaver.  No big deal if you have a fast internet connection, but I know a few people who are stuck with a slow DSL speed.

In the end, you'll be familiar with the program's interface, and hopfully you will learn how to use the essential commands and tools to create and design websites.  It also identifies some areas that are typically and easily overlooked.

The book (printed guide) is glued onto the packaging with those sticky gel dots.  Though it can be separated from the box, it was not immediately obvious and I ended up carrying the entire package with me.  I wish the book was kept separated or maybe in a pocket.  No big deal.

33,A14JBDSWKPKTZA,0321719816,"I have had Dreamweaver MX2004 since it came out back then. Spent years with it. Feel like I know it real well, but I am still familiar with tables as opposed to CSS. So I thought this would be a great introduction, and it is. The problem is that while I am looking at the video, and that simplifies things a lot, I am not getting the intuitive explanation as to why things work the way they do. I understand just knowing how to work them is sufficient. I'm tempted to delve into the rich full attributes of Dreamweaver CS5 as explained by this video, albeit difficult to understand the more advanced features, but I won't because this is about the video.

The opening salvo is chock full of... for example, this is the URL; this is where you type in the address bar etc. Only when you start to get into areas such as CSS do you get an introduction that for me is beneficial, and that is only because I am somewhat of a newbie to it. So there you have it, do you get an advanced lesson that flies through things and most find it hard to understand, or do you get this one and appreciate the fact that she walks you through everything step by step, even at the risk of boring the more in the know people, but finally arriving at the section you need to learn, and then appreciate that she is not moving at lightning speed.

I'm holding off buying Dreamweaver CS5, although I got the upgrade to Photoshop CS5 and love it, because my MX2004 is not an eligible upgrade version. If I could qualify for the upgrade I would grab it, but the learning curve of CSS, and the steep price for the full version when I have MX2004 already is giving me some hesitation. If I was to upgrade, or should I say take the leap to the full version, this tutorial is the one I would use, and I also recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Dreamweaver-CS5-on-Demand/dp/0789744449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 on Demand</a>&nbsp;which makes a very good reference guide.
At some point I will get the new version of CS5 Dreamweaver, and at that point I will do the entire video series, and have a much more in depth analysis of it.

34,AH4NKNB6TYXRE,0321719816,"Summary: EXTREMELY slow pace, awful stilted narration, redundant lessons and completely unprofessional page designs (imagine a mySpace page designed by a 13-year-old). HOWEVER, if you are a complete novice then this disc will teach you a lot. Just be prepared for a very very slow pace. If you've never designed a web page then this may get you started but it will probably leave you lost after a while, because although she spends a lot of time explaining things almost as elementary as how to use a mouse, she does not cover much of the most basic web design fundamentals you would get in a beginning course at a school. And you will only be shown extremely childish examples of actual visual design and layout of web pages. If you have designed a web page before, then there is probably 30 minutes of material at the end of the course that will be useful, and if you don't mind clawing your eyes out in frustration then you could take the time to watch some of the earlier lessons to learn about the Dreamweaver interface. However, as another reviewer noted, there is not detailed index, so you will spend a lot of time skipping through lessons to find the salient parts. There are many ""lessons"" where all she does is talk about what she is going to teach you in the next lesson, i.e. teaching you nothing.

I used to code basic HTML by hand, but never learned CSS, so I wanted to learn it with this tutorial. I expected that to be part of the lessons but obviously not the majority. I also got Dreamweaver a while ago but haven't used it in years. I was patient at first, but then after a few hours of the most basic interface issues being hounded upon over and over again, I started skipping through lessons. And the author doesn't just give detailed lessons on how to use the Dreamweaver interface; she also goes in-depth to describe how to use basic OS functionality. Add to that her awkward, stilted speech and nasal voice (I'm not trying to be mean, but it just isn't professional), and I was pulling my hair out, even when listening to the lessons that I was interested in.

Examples:

* The bottom 10px of so of the screen in the videos is cut off, so that sometimes the narrator is referring
  to something she's doing, but her cursor and what she's clicking on are not visible on the screen. In addition
  there is a LARGE ""video2brain"" watermark obscuring some of the vital controls in the bottom right corner of the
  screen, once again making it impossible to understand exactly what she is doing in the Dreamweaver interface.

* An entire lesson (3:30 min) spent explaining how to create a new folder on your hard drive and change it's name.

* Several minutes spent explaining how to open and close palettes and windows in Dreamweaver. (Not rocket science.)

* Way too much time spent explaining basic OS/Browser functionality: Save/Save As functions, untitled documents,
  naming HTML files, where page titles display on a browser window, how to bookmark sites in a browser and how
  browser tabs work. None of this begins to expain how to use Dreamweaver, let alone build a web page.

* The history of meta tags, featuring the quote ""It's a meta tag because it has HTML brackets and it says 'meta'.""

* An entire lesson (6.4) explaining how to select, copy and paste text -- elementary OS functionality. Really,
  noting to do with Dreamweaver here! I'm not exaggerating. That was the lesson.

* 5 minutes spent on making bold or italic text (not an exaggeration). Not via CSS either, just regular ""strong""
  and ""i"" tags, and using the clickable buttons [B] [I] to set them in Dreamweaver.

* Time spent explaining how those little triangles on drop-down menus indicate that they are a menu with choices
  that can be accessed. Didn't the first Mac television commercial in 1984 already cover that subject in-depth?
  Or was that the Minesweeper tutorial?

* Time wasted explaining how to select all text. Not something tricky about how to select text and not catch code
  characters by mistake, just valuable time spent explaining that you could hit control-A to select all.

* Six minutes and thirty seconds spent explaining what the different types of HTML links are. Not HOW to create them.
  Not anything about styling them, or using javascript with them, or anything fancy like that. More than SIX MINUTES
  explaining that you can have a basic hyperlink or an anchor link, perhaps talking about relative vs. absolute URL paths.

* An example of her slow, wordy manner of speech. She adds 20px margin to something. Rather than saying ""that will
  now add 20px around all sides of the object,"" instead she says it ""adds 20px to the right...the bottom...the left...
  and the top edges."" Now imagine that statement taking 10 seconds to utter.

* The booklet is glued inside the box that the DVD comes in, so it is very inconvenient to reference or read
  (bulky and inflexible).

This video was quite obviously not scripted. The narrator makes several flubs throughout and laughs about them. She CONSTANTLY repeats herself from one lesson to another, which wouldn't be so bad if it was just a reference to what she taught us in a former lesson, but she invariably re-teaches that lesson again, so that you are begging on your hands and knees to be taught something new, anything! If you want to see an example of the author's web design capacity, take a look at my screen capture added to the product photos, taken from this DVD, where she shows a picture of her personal website which apparently has templates available for download. It absolutely boggles the mind that this woman would be officially Certified by Adobe. And according to her bio on the product page, she is also a ""Certified Internet Webmaster."" Let's dial the Wayback Machine all the back to 1995 and learn about what kind of responsibility THAT entails.

Lessons pertaining to CSS start at 11.2, which is dozens of lessons in. They do have some decent info.

Overall, I think you can get better training by either going on YouTube (free!

35,A19W47CXJJP1MI,0321719816,"For the cost of about $40 and 12 hours of your time, you can pretty effectively learn Adobe's Dreamweaver CS5 at your own pace and location. It is not a DVD that you just pop into a DVD player to sit back and watch passively on TV. In fact, this DVD is only playable on the computer, because it requires you to use the mouse to select many of its options.  It's interactive and allows you to go to any and section as needed. At the end of each chapter, there is a test that you can take to see how well you have been learning.

There are 17 chapters and each chapter is divided into various sections. In the Training Content screen, which is the home screen when you play the DVD, each chapter and section has its heading clearly spelled out, so that you know where to go when you are looking for a particular video. It's the sections that you can click to play; the chapters are just ""folder names"" for organization purposes. Each section can vary from less than 3 minutes to more than 13 minutes long, depending on the complexity of the topic discussed. You can pause the video at any time, and there is captioning at the bottom of the screen to enhance your learning experience. The sub-titling is also valuable for non-English learners to help them understand what was spoken.

If you are a beginner, the best way to learn this program is to start from chapter 1, section 1 and proceed in order to the last chaper, because this video starts with the basics and progresses to more and more complex topics.

Compared to classroom instruction, I prefer using this Learn by Video DVD because it is very well produced with the instructor speaking clearly and the contents well organized.

38,A14638TGYH7GD9,0321719816,"Even though I use Dreamweaver a great deal and own several books on the subject, I found this set very helpful. Candyce Mairs takes you through everything, from opening the program and setting up your desktop to creating a site. The focus is on the software, not on CSS or HTML or web design, so you'll end up with a through understanding of just how the software is designed to work.

The videos are brief, with clear screenshots and step by step narration which is subtitled. When occasionally the narrator makes a small error (""Fireworks"" for ""Firefox,"" say), the subtitles correct it. The pace is slow but focused and always on task -- no rambling or making and fixing errors on screen.

Since each video looks at just one issue, it's very easy to find your way back if you feel confused. I like the ""Watch and work"" option, too, which lets you keep the video running in the corner of your screen so that you can work along with the video.

New features of CS5 are pointed out in detail, not only in the video training but in the accompanying booklet, which also has tables of keyboard shortcuts, a glossary, and lots of example code.

If you're upgrading and want to master the new features immediately or if you usually hand code and want to get to know all the timesaving features of Dreamweaver, this is exactly what you need. If you're a moderately skilled web designer and would like to increase your skills, improving your ability to use Spry, for example, this is an excellent choice.

39,A2VWE5SGNDS8HW,0321719816,"I waited to complete the entire course before writing this review and, in no particular order, these are my observations.

I should tell you that my web skills are limited. I used Front Page for years and have created several very elementary Dreamweaver sites for family members. I'm in the process of trying to work more professionally (cleaner, less, and better code) and more creatively (a less stilted and more unique and appealing design). This course doesn't purport to be a web design course, it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a (relatively simple) website and it's going to teach you how to implement it. Don't expect inspiration.

POSITIVE:
* Level: absolute beginner to intermediate.
*  It is entirely DVD-based. The booklet (106 pages including index) that comes with the DVD just provides additional random information; it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course.
* The scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple Dreamweaver CS5 website. You do become familiar with the DW interface; the workflow; best practices; web and DW terminology; and basic website structure and creation.
* The sequence and progression is logical and sequential. There is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation.
* The interface is very well thought out. You can go backwards or forwards easily. It has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search (by both topic and subtopics) in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic. It allows you to bookmark (with long notes-to-self) on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to. The interface coloring and design are neutral and un-intrusive. The screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away.
* The course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the Adobe Certified Expert (ACE) test. Each main section has a practice test at the end.
* Another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen (optional). This is particularly helpful if you're in in a public place where you can't turn on the sound.
* All explanations of hard-to-grasp concepts (ex: the box model) are clearly demonstrated with visual examples. As a matter of fact, this is the clearest explanation I have ever seen of the box model.
* I did find the booklet section on Fireworks instructive, since I have never used that program in the past. In fact, the entire booklet is very instructive and useful--it's just totally unrelated to the course on DVD.

NOT SO POSITIVE:
* Coverage of other concepts, such as content placement and positioning, are a little more basic and less detailed than I would have liked. I can't recall (or locate now) any reference to floats, whereas AP divs and frames (both older concepts) are well covered.
* The narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction, but is somewhat monotone and unexciting.
* There is no ""search"" function or ""index."" This makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents. I would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable, but it isn't.
* For my learning style, I would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so I could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration (and is easier to go back to or use as reference material.)
* The bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer. If you want to change to your desktop, the bookmarks, obviously, are not there. So as a ""personal index"" these bookmarks have their limits.

On the whole, I do recommend this course. I wish I had taken it earlier, because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that I had just taken. However, I think that, for a person who is learning-as-you-go (not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website) it is essential to have reference material on Dreamweaver CS5, some sort of guidance on design principles, and a solid HTML and CSS anthology--all in well-indexed books.

41,A9ELHLPXF7JKD,0321700945,"This video is accompanied by a small book that covers general areas of interest within the field of photography.  It also offers general coverage of the new features in Lightroom 3, has a guide to keyboard shortcuts (very useful), and a glossary.  Thumbs up on the book.

The video material, contained on a single DVD, does a good job of covering all the important aspects of Lightroom 3.  This video is in my opinion, for advanced beginners on up.  I say this because the material is covered more deeply than what a beginner in the field of digital photography might be comfortable with.  Also, it is assumed that the student has some knowledge of digital photographic concepts (white balance, exposure, RAW format, etc.).  These topics are discussed without much intro-type explanation for beginners.  For me this is a good thing, as I had a reasonably good background going in.

The only thing that I wasn't thrilled about, although it is no reason to drop a star, is the pace of the training.  I actually like a faster pace.  If something is too fast, I just play it over.  The slower pace of this video training wouldn't bother me at all if there were a fast forward button that allowed me to still comprehend what is being said.  The only way I could speed things up was to skip ahead in small increments and then go back if I went too far.

Here's the bottom line.  You can have no experience with Lightroom, but if you are a beginner with digital photography, bone up before hitting this video.  You'll get much more out of it.

This package consists of a DVD and a small book. The book has a chapter on being a better photographer and another introducing the new features of Lightroom 3.

44,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,0321700945,"I was lucky to find this offered in the Vine program as I'd just upgraded to Lightroom 3, and had been looking for a good text or other training material. It's pretty complete in its coverage of Lightroom basics, and differences from Lightroom 2; the only real issue I have is with the pacing. And that's not a real complaint about the product; it's more of a personal preference.

What you get in the package is a slim volume of 100 pages, about half of which discuss Lightroom and photography in general terms; the remaining 50 pages are divided between notes on setting preferences in Lightroom and tables of keystroke shortcuts. Given that the booklet is glued into the packaging, it's not exactly a handy references. The bulk of the course, though, is on a disk that contains (as noted in the description) a full 10 hours of video lessons.

The lessons are divided up functionally in a manner that reflects Lightrooom's functional division- the first section is devoted to importing photos, followed by a section on the Library function. Each section is in turn divided into lessons covering one or two detailed areas. You can play all the sections and lessons in order, or pick and choose as you like. I began by playing straight through the first two sections (over two separate sessions) and picked up a lot of new and useful information about using Lightroom 3. Each lesson involves watching an expert carry out some function while narrating exactly what he's doing. The demonstrations and accompanying narration afre very clear, and made it easy for me to perform the same actions on my own. There's also a ""watch and work"" mode, in which you can shrink the video window down and try an example on your own in Lightroom, using supplied data files. Very nice.

What I particularly liked was the us of professional photographers, rather than trainers, to present the material. The result is a real-world approach, in which the instructor both demonstrates the full range of options for some piece (like importing) and then explains exactly how he uses this in his own workflow. What you get is not a theoretical exploration of how a piece of software could be used, but a real demonstration of how it's being used by someone working in the field. Of course, that can be a drawback, too; one particular photographer's idiosyncratic methods may not be best for you. But I think this program manages to avoid that, but presenting the full range of possible approaches before the instructor gives his personal preference.

The one problem I do have with the course is, I suppose, unavoidable in this sort of presentation, and that's that the videos are fixed in duration and what's covered. Going through everything is going to take you the full 10 hours, at a minimum. You may look ahead to one chapter for something you're specifically interested in, only to discover after watching it through that what you really need is in a different chapter. That's why I generally prefer a text and image based approach. For me, at least, reading is several times faster than listening. But as I say, that's just my personal preference.

45,A1QWCRVV9VNLOK,0321700945,"I was extremely pleased with this training video. The video player was very full featured; far better than any I have used in other video training I have used. Look over intro page ix of the accompanying book to get an over view if it's capabilities. Although it launches full screen, it can be reduced in size like any other on-screen window. Find the small handle at the lower right. You could of course shrink it down to the task bar, but it runs and looks great at both small and large sizes. What's more, you can pause the video at anytime, run you own copy of Lightroom and actually work through the same steps you are learning about. In fact, the image used on the DVD are also included on the DVD, so you could repeat the lessons with the identical images. (The video lessons are also on the DVD in .mp4 and .3gp format, so you may be able to work through some lessons on your iPhone/iPad or 3G cell phone while commuting.)

It will pay to pause the first lesson and explore the user interface of the DVD playback software. It's not as complicated as LR itself, but quirky enough to make starting off somewhat confusing. You'll want to explore the LR interface at some point too.

The Lightroom (LR) interface is designed around a good, flexible work flow, and the lessons generally follow that workflow. Of course, in actual use you can easily jump around the interface as you want, but seeing the software in an actual work flow is terrific. LR, like Photoshop, is a deep product, and watching it being used is actually far easier to do than trying to follow step-by-step instructions from a book.

The DVD comes with a small book which you can remove from the packaging; it's got those small sticky pads holding the back of the book to the box. Just lift off carefully. The first half of the book is entitled ""The Photograper's Eye"" by Michael Jordan (but not that Michael Jordan.) This seems like basic filler, and is not related to Lightroom at all. The last half is pretty good, although a lot of those ridiculously small screen shots are included. The material covered is duplicated in  Lesson 1.4 to 1.4.9 so you can at least see a much bigger image. There is also a handy keyboard shortcuts list. The book is also handy in case you want to change some of the settings without reloading the DVD.

I have a few quibbles. In general, this DVD is aimed at Lightroom beginners. But much of Lesson 1 (1.1 to 1.3.7) deals with ""What's New in LR3"" which is almost useless, and frankly confusing, for someone using LR3 the first time. (If you just upgraded from an earlier version, this might be more interesting.) Start up your own LR and jump to 1.4 to begin the process of customizing your setup. At 1.4 you get a really useful, well explained review of the many LR settings.

If you start with the 'Play All' option, as recommended, the interface takes you automatically from lesson to lesson, although there is no visual indication of which lesson and chapter number you are actually on. The titles are shown on the right hand sidebar (Chapter Videos) if you open it, but not the lesson numbers. You can use the dropdown at the top of the main dialog to see this, however. You can choose specific lessons from the opening main screen if desired. As you go, you can set bookmarks for sections you might like to revisit.

46,A3T7V207KRDE2O,0321700945,"Learn By Video Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3

I have Lightroom 2.7 so I was intrigued for two reasons: 1) what is new in Lightroom 3 that I should upgrade and 2) could I still learn something about the version that I have with this video. I am happy to say it exceeded my expectations.

The lessons are good; I actually look forward to learning more about Lightroom. The lessons are always focused on the computer screen - not wasted on watching the instructor speak. First I went through some of the lessons to get an overview of the features - some I found were explained in a way that made me realize that I should have been using them. But I will really use this as a reference when I want to work on my photos with the Watch and Work.

Watch and Work is a really cool feature. If you click Watch and Work (in the lower right corner) the application shrinks down and is placed in the upper left corner sort of out of the way. I say sort of because it is always on top and on my screen I am not able to get Lightroom completely visible. I can't find a minimize button so I have to go back to standard mode and then minimize it. But it does work and is a quick way to get the video up while I am working. (It's probably time I get another monitor...) The DVD does come with samples but I have no problem following along using my own photos.

While the lessons themselves are great I did find a few quirks.

When you first put in the disc Windows 7 pops up suggesting to run Start.exe. Choosing that starts the video with an intro from the two authors but there is no mention how to use the program. Fortunately there is a Table of Content in the upper left corner which is how I actually go through this. It isn't terribly difficult to use the video but it would make for a smoother and less timely start if they went over the use of it. The booklet does explain a little but not completely which goes for the help screen as well.

There is no install for the DVD. DVDs are either watched once or used for installation. Since I will use this as a reference and it will be used over and over they should have included an install so that you will always have access to the video. You can copy the entire DVD to your hard drive and setup a shortcut but for a lot of users that isn't always easy to do.

Right away I found an annoying orange menu that pops up even if I slightly bump the mouse. All it has are options for Full Screen or an info sidebar. These options are also available in the lower right corner. At first I wasn't sure if it was part their screen shots or the application on my computer. I have not yet found any info that explains this or how to turn it off and I have no use for this menu - strictly annoying.

Another annoyance is when you close the application it goes through the list, or credits, of who put it together. Why? My experience as a developer is that no one cares who created it; if it's good people will use it. But we get to see them every single time.
Tip: although it is an added step after you click the close button, click again and you won't have to wait through the credits.

The package comes with a booklet but it doesn't offer much. Half of it explains photography and how to take certain shots. If you are using Lightroom chances are you probably have several photography books already. Another section briefly goes through each of the new features in 3. And there is a section that shows the specific settings for certain screens and another section on the shortcuts. The booklet is not an alternative to learning the application but may be a handy reference for some.

The begin where you left off doesn't work for me in fact it suggested something I used yesterday.

But I really do look forward to learning Lightroom with this video. It is far better than the free ones I have found online. And it even helps me with 2.7. Once installed on my hard drive it works great as a quick reference. I am still debating on upgrading Lightroom at least right away.

47,A1F6PIIZ0ZHHD6,0321700945,"Some people learn more by watching than by reading. I know that I first learned about how to use Lightroom in videos by the redoubtable Michael Reichmann and Jeff Schewe, but that was mostly because they were the first out with instructional material. Mostly those videos were images of talking heads with an occasional screen shot. ""Learn Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 by Video"" is an offering by two other great image processing authors, Tim Grey and Mikkel Aaland.

The approach taken is fairly standard. After an introduction the videos go chapter by chapter through each of the Lightroom modules, and an examination of most of the buttons and sliders that, because of its easy interface, has made Lightroom popular with so many photographers.  Each section shows a screen shot where the viewer can follow the moves made by the authors to apply Lightroom functions, accompanied by the voice-over of one of the two authors. The chapters cover everything from bringing images into Lightroom to outputting them to web sites or slideshows. The level of instruction is fairly simple, but if you've never used the software, the instruction will get the average person processing pictures after several hours of watching. More experienced users won't learn anything new, but they are not the audience. Not every function is covered in all aspects, like my favorite test, whether the discussion of keywords covers the importation of a keyword list from another source into Lightroom. On the other hand, although this isn't covered, it clearly a subject for a more advanced user.

At the end of each chapter there is an examination. Unfortunately, if you get an answer wrong, you won't be told the correct answer, so you'll have to watch the lesson again. Maybe that's not unfortunate.

The video comes with a booklet where Aaland first presents some ideas about composition (perhaps added because the video, like most Lightroom books, doesn't tell you when a slider or button is appropriate; for that, I'd recommend ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vision-Voice-Refining-Your-Vision-in-Adobe-Photoshop-Lightroom-Voices-That-Matter/dp/0321670094/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vision & Voice: Refining Your Vision in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom (Voices That Matter)</a>"" by David duChemin). That's followed by a chapter about what's new in Lightroom 3. The disk also contains images that can be imported into Lightroom by the viewer to follow the same procedures as the authors in the lessons. I'd like to say that this allows one to follow along with the authors, but it was here that video presentation encountered a stumbling block. With a book you could keep the book in front of the computer and, if images were provided, the reader could follow along. To duplicate the experience there is a button in the lower right hand corner of the video screen, called ""Watch-and-Work"". If you click this, the video is reduced to about one-fourth of the screen. Unfortunately, when I tried to follow along with the video, the video image was often in the way and had to be moved around to gain access to the Lightroom sliders. Eventually I figured out that it was easier to pause the video and minimize the video screen and work in Lightroom. This doesn't take a computer guru to figure out, but given that the videos are aimed at tyros, it might have been useful to provide more detailed instructions in how to use the videos. Unfortunately there is just a very brief help screen, that, to make matters worse, refers to processing the picture in Dreamweaver! It might also have been useful to suggest to users that as soon as possible, they should import the images provided on the disk into Lightroom, as well as other instructions on how to best use the videos to learn.

I'm still a person who prefers books, being a geezer who didn't grow up with YouTube. I underline important ideas or read them twice, and even read them on a bus, without opening a laptop. To be fair, the video does allow for bookmarking (again undocumented), that accomplishes many of these functions and perhaps reading on the bus may not be the best way to learn about running a piece of software like Lightroom.

57,A3V15SFD7918WZ,0321700945,"Had a chance to try this out, here are a few impressions:

Easy to use, well-designed, and useful.

BUT... at a fairly basic ""this is Lightroom"" level.  So, if you're new to Lightroom, and a visual learner (as opposed to wanting to read everything in a book), this is an awesome resource.  It's kind of like having an experienced photographer friend sit down with you and a copy of LR3 for 10 hours and go over every feature, in a reasonable degree of depth, one feature at a time.  But you get to pause, rewind, and rewatch it whenever you want, add bookmarks to favorite parts you want to review later, etc.

You can also learn LR3 on your own; that's what I did.  I'd been using the program for over a year before getting this, so I didn't think I had much to learn.  While I wasn't sure how useful this would be, I was pleasantly surprised.  I use primarily the Library and Develop modules (all the time), and was hoping to learn more about the other three (Print, Web, and Slideshow).  I certainly did, and am comfortable with those now.  But I also learned some pretty useful things about the ones I use constantly (I haven't really used collections before, for instance, and that's going to be a huge time-saver).

The two photographers that guide you through lightroom introduce you to all of its features, but don't necessarily give too much creative input... they teach you what you CAN do, not what TO do.  For most people, this is fine.  But they're not there to refine and hone your creativity.  Just get you familiar with the program, which they do very well.

What I'm a little disappointed by is that I didn't get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learn-Adobe-Photoshop-CS5-by-Video-Core-Training-in-Visual-Communication-Learn-by-Video/dp/0321719808/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learn Adobe Photoshop CS5 by Video: Core Training in Visual Communication (Learn by Video)</a>&nbsp;instead.  I don't know Photoshop nearly as well as I know Lightroom.  And while Lightroom isn't too hard to figure out without a guide, Photoshop is pretty much impossible.  And that particular video item, while the same price as this, has over twice as much video (21 hours instead of 10).  If you're trying to learn both programs, I'd probably recommend getting that instead, and figuring out LR3 on your own.

Oh, and it comes with a book.  The book is a little odd, as it doesn't really go along with the product.  Instead, it has three main sections:  The first, is basically a ""welcome to photography, here's what you need to know to capture nice images"" with basic photographic advice.  Part 2 is ""what's new in LR3"" (compared to previous versions; only newly added stuff is mentioned).

63,A3V7D0LH8L7BG0,0321700945,"I am a long time user of Photoshop Lightroom, from the first version. I used to use Photoshop to manage and edit digital images, but switched to LR totally from then. LR is relatively user-friendly, you need very little instruction to get started. I never had any training, book or instructions of anykind, but always felt efficient with the software.

Well, I think it is great that I now have access to this training video. It was kind of long (10 hrs.), so finding the time to watch them was a challenge. Especially for me, as I already know how to use the software. But of course, you will pick up things that you don't know before or how to do it better. And it is true. I learned more than I expected.

68,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,0321719824,"The ""Learn by Video"" program for Flash CS5 would make a nice alternative to an introductory book - especially for visual learners.  I'd worked through the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Flash-Professional-CS5-Classroom-in-a-Book/dp/0321701801/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book</a>&nbsp;- and found that to be more comprehensive in its coverage, but there is a different emphasis here and I found I learned quite a bit that I didn't know or that wasn't clear before.  The little booklet that comes with the guide is an extremely useful introduction to design principles that are essential to effective working in Flash.

There are several chapters on different introductory-level topics in Flash CS5.  Each is broken up into different sections, and usually these can be completed in under ten minutes each.  That makes this easy to work through in short sections.  You can set bookmarks to remember where you left off - although it would be nicer if the program saved your progress directly and remembered for you where you left off.  The exposition is clear, but perhaps a bit dry.  There's no hint of humor here, and I always find it helps to make verbal lessons a bit more interesting and memorable.  Each section tells you what you are going to learn, gives you an explanation and a tutorial you can follow along using one of the project files included on the dvd, and then explains what you have learned.

The focus here is on learning how things work and what things mean at a fairly basic level.  You don't get very advanced, and by the end of things you'd really just have a rough idea of how things work in Flash, but it is very clear.  They assume a listener who is just getting started with Flash, and, while the lessons are sequential and they build upon each other, they remind you what you've learned and how to do things several times.  Sometimes that's a bit frustrating - in a beginner's level textbook it's easy just to skim through the repetition when it is familiar - with video it's harder to skim through what is inessential without missing the important bits.  That's one reason to prefer something like the ""Classroom in a Book"" series, rather than the Video Classroom approach.

One thing I got here more clearly than in the ""Classroom in a Book"" for Flash CS5 is an emphasis on best practices - how to manage projects so as to be completely clear, and how that helps to achieve control over the project.  There is more explanation here - more whys behind the hows.  I thought the chapter on Action Script was excellent for giving a clear concept of how it works as an ""object based"" language - even though you'd only be able to do some very rudimentary things after working through the entire chapter, you'd have a pretty decent understanding of how the language works and a good basis for further learning.  There are video files on the disk that allow you to follow along on what they show you in the tutorials.  One thing they don't make clear is that to work with them you have to copy the assets folder to your hard drive and open and work with the projects there.  (I find it most convenient to backup the entire dvd to my hard drive and play it from there - since that means it's available and ready whenever I want to work through a section, and it also helps to protect the original disk from scratching).

Overall, it's a good introduction to Flash and the emphasis on ""Best Practices"" serves as a useful complement to the ""how to"" guides you can find in other introductory Flash books.  I do have a few minor gripes:  the navigation through the chapter files is not as intuitive as I'd like: there are sections and subsections, and you can go to the next section in a chapter by clicking the ""Next Video"" button.  But: when you get to the end of a subsection, the ""Next Video"" button is not enabled and you have to go back to the main index and then open up the chapter index again to get to the next section in the chapter.  Several words in the projects are misspelt (e.g. ""Hawaiin"" instead of ""Hawaiian""), and I also noticed that at least one of the project files they encourage you to use was missing (the ""inverseKinematics_start.fla"" file from chapter 9).  Still, the guide as a whole is very helpful and clear - and the emphasis on design principles in the included booklet makes this a very helpful overview and introduction to a rich and complicated program.",Softwares,2010-11-27,4,positive,learn video program flash cs5 would make nice alternative introductory book especially visual learners id worked thenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefadobeflashprofessionalcs5classroominabookdprefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieutf8adobe flash professional cs5 classroom bookanbsp found comprehensive coverage but different emphasis found learned quite bit didnt know wasnt clear little booklet comes guide extremely useful introduction design principles essential effective working flash several chapters different introductorylevel topics flash cs5 broken different sections usually completed ten minutes makes easy work short sections bookmarks remember left although would nicer program saved progress directly remembered left exposition clear but perhaps bit dry theres no hint humor always find helps make verbal lessons bit interesting memorable section tells going learn gives explanation tutorial follow along using one project files included dvd explains learned focus learning things work things mean fairly basic level dont get advanced end things youd really rough idea things work flash but clear assume listener getting started flash lessons sequential build upon remind youve learned things several times sometimes thats bit frustrating beginners level textbook easy skim repetition familiar video harder skim inessential without missing important bits thats one reason prefer something classroom book series rather video classroom approach one thing got clearly classroom book flash cs5 emphasis best practices manage projects completely clear helps achieve control project explanation whys behind hows thought chapter action script excellent giving clear concept works object based language even though youd able rudimentary things working entire chapter youd pretty decent understanding language works good basis learning video files disk allow follow along show tutorials one thing dont make clear work copy assets folder hard drive open work projects find convenient backup entire dvd hard drive play since means available ready whenever want work section also helps protect original disk scratching overall good introduction flash emphasis best practices serves useful complement guides find introductory flash books minor gripes navigation chapter files not intuitive id sections subsections go next section chapter clicking next video button but get end subsection next video button not enabled go back main index open chapter index get next section chapter several words projects misspelt eg hawaiin instead hawaiian also noticed least one project files encourage missing inversekinematicsstartfla file chapter still guide whole helpful clear emphasis design principles included booklet makes helpful overview introduction rich complicated program,0.11899999999999997,positive,58.0,positive,positive
69,A3FQDU9WANNZZR,0321719824,"In theory, the idea of watching a video tutorial while operating the program it's teaching is a great idea, but the implementation is at times flawed and frustrating.

It appears that the tutorial is built on Adobe Air, which make Javascript look positively robust and blazing. The interface is slow and quite unresponsive on a fast Mac. It's very frustrating that it is not aware of dual monitor setups either. There is an option to watch it full screen, but if you try to place the video tutorial on a second monitor -- which would be customary if the program you are trying to learn was on your main monitor -- clicking on ""full-screen"" jumps the tutorial to your main display and makes it full-screen there, covering up the Flash program!

The content and organization is pretty well done for beginner to intermediate level Flash programmers, but the numerous typos give it an  amateur whiff. How can there be typos in a video you ask? Well, the Video Training INSISTS on turning closed captioning on by default. No matter how many times you turn it off, when you relaunch the training, it appears again.

70,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,0321719824,"The presenter here sounds much more natural than the semi-robotic delivery found in the DreamWeaver tutorial product.

The lessons are broken up into easily digested 3-5 minute chunks, covering aspects of Flash from project planning and defining customer needs to an introduction to ActionScript fundamentails. Although it does not deal with programming in detail, it does cover basic concepts of object-oriented programming, variables, conditional statements, and functions. The rest covers working with artwork and text; library and symbols; layers, timeline, animation, and tweens; working with files, sound and video. You'll learn the fundamentals; you won't learn how to create those fancy user interfaces on those fancy sites; that's for a more advanced class.

As with other products in this series, there are some usability issues. At the top of the interface, there's a ""Previous Video"" button and ""Next Video"" button. The ""Next Video"" button is disabled for the last video of each chapter, so to get to the next one you'll have to use other navigation. This is because the last item is the test. Kinda dumb UI choice, initially confusing. They could have changed it to read ""Take Test"" instead of putting up a virtual dead end. There is a sidebar which is normally hidden (you are cued that you can display it when the mouse strays into the video area), which has information on the current video and lists/links to the other videos in the chapter. The title bar (under the top-left tabs) is a dropdown to navigate the content.

There's a ""Watch and Work"" mode which shrinks the video display to let you work with your copy of DreamWeaver (not included). You can move the video window around BUT you CANNOT resize it - and it may be kind of tiny to watch in that mode. So if you have a dual monitor setup, you'll want to drag the Standard Mode video player to the other screen; Standard Mode cannot be resized to be smaller, either.

All in all it's a good way to get started in Flash programming, if you don't have the patience for going through a book.

71,AK9FTWLCW09RR,0321719824,"If you've seen neat Flash presentations and wondered how you can create them yourself, this book will get you started in the right direction.  It contains a DVD and a hundred page book supplement.  The DVD provides well-done video tutorials that you can follow along in watch-and-work mode using the starter work files included in the DVD, and the book provides useful reference materials (e.g., colored screenshots of user interfaces and how to use the various tool components, keyboard short cuts for specific tasks, etc.)

The video lessons cover all the important basics: how to create work projects and organize your files; how to use various tools and features; what are objects, shapes, symbols, movie clips, timelines, layers, frames, stage, etc; how to work with text and graphics; how to create animations such as objects moving in a choreographed fashion (motion tweens), or shapes morphing into other shapes (shape tweens); how to include ActionScript code snippets for more dynamic (but still simple) handling of events; how to build not just good-looking designs and presentations but also simple applications that react to text inputs, button presses, and mouse clicks; and how to test and deploy your work. By the time you're done with the lessons, you'll have an appreciation of how powerful Flash CS5 is and how learning even just the few techniques introduced in this video guide already empowers you to do interesting stuff!

The user interface for the video tutorials is easy to use, and although the book supplement comes with instructions on how to use that interface and navigate through the tutorials, most people should be able to figure out how to use the interface without having read those instructions first.

The video lessons are organized into eight chapters, most of which end with test questions that give you additional opportunities to revisit what you have just learned.  For the most part, the test questions quiz your knowledge of what was covered not just in the video lessons but also related materials in the book supplement; given that the video lessons and the chapters in the book supplement do not track each other perfectly (for example, the video lessons introduce motion tweens before shape tweens, but the supplement reverses this order), if you focus on the video lessons only, you might occasionally be surprised at getting quizzed on something that appeared unfamiliar by virtue of the fact that you might have missed reading some relevant materials presented (probably out of order) in the supplement.

Finally, I thought that while some of the materials in the video lessons are somewhat repetitious, the instructors have nevertheless done a good job showcasing some of the most useful features of Flash.

Over the years I've gone through many books to help students learn all aspects of Flash from the basics of using the timeline, creatign and using symbols, managing tweening, and everything else. Of course I can show the students everything there is to know about Flash but I always found it hard to find a complete training tool that students can use in the classroom and at home to complement my teachings.

I pretty much went through every book on the market, whether in be the 'Visual Guide' series or the ones from Adobe or anything in between.

The course provides a good introduction to the  CS5 user interface, the Flash tools, file types, and managing the timeline.  There's also a very basic chapter that introduces ActionScript (AS3), which is the coding language used to create complex logic in a Flash application. The AS3 material is extremely basic--too basic in my opinion.

Again, I like the production of this video package. The videos can be played in Windows, Mac, or Linux. There are also MP4 versions of the video files, in case you want to view them on a portable device (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, etc.). This is helpful if you want to view the videos and work hands-on on your computer, although the small screen would be difficult.  The DVD also includes a collection of asset files that correspond with the lessons.

83,ADDDFVHP3CSVA,0321719824,"Recently going through school to obtain an IT degree I had wanted to take Flash as well but just didn't have enough time or cash to fit it into my degree program. This seems like a pretty viable way, with a good price, to get a handle on Adobe Flash CS5.

I read the intro, plugged it in and thought I was going to just take off with it. The vocal on the presentation are pleasing and easy to understand. If you miss something it is *so easy* to back up and hear it again. There is closed caption at the bottom, but if you need that, good luck...it is pretty tiny. It took me a while to set things up so that I could use the assets that come along with the classes (or even find them) in order to do a 'hands-on' follow along with the lessons. Was pretty frustrating to set up an environment to do that as you can't save back to the DVD and Flash liked to argue with me about the destination of the items I wanted to save.

Ended up just copying the DVD onto my computer and then using the files from there (but starting from the DVD itself) worked fine. Another thing I noticed is that when it opens up the tutorial screen is huge and not scalable. This to me is a royal pain because I wanted to work AND watch the video. There is a *work and watch* mode you can put it into, however then the *watch* portion becomes very small and you cannot minimize it without going back into regular mode (which is not full screen mode, but takes the whole screen without being able to 'down size it' like other items I am used to.

Those frustrations aside, it is a sharp presentation that includes tests and items to help you make sure you capture the essence of what is being taught. I really *do* like it and when completed, it touts, that you will have learned all the skills necessary to become a 'Rich Media Communication Adobe Certified Associate'.

His examples and explanations clarified what for me were difficult problems.

Experienced film editors will probably not need this video; people new to film editing and the Adobe program will greatly benefit from it though. The actual creation of short, coherent movies from multiple clips in the video is a teaching technique that registers: I picked up some difficult concepts quickly because of this.

Chad Perkins the host is intelligent and personable. His knowledge and subtle sense of humor made the many hours of teaching fly by fast. However, one viewing will not be enough.

90,AY6XJYOFLOEOK,0321898354,"I bought Adobe Premier Elements 11 because I wanted to learn how to edit the footage that I was able to get out of my new Canon rebel T3I. I figured that because I was a whiz at Microsoft office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, etc.) that I could just turn it on and it would be easy to pick it up. What I learned was that just because you're a whiz at 1 kind of software made by 1 company doesn't mean anything when you go to software made by another company. I could not get past just turning it on. Everything was so different. I got worried and figured that I needed help to learn this. I didn't want to spend some more money but if I didn't the software that I had already bought was going to be worthless to me.

I sure am glad that I chose to get this. In the first 30 seconds of the DVD I learned an easier way to add media (video, audio, pictures) than what I had learned in studying Adobe's website for an hour. After watching it all, it seems so simple now. The narrator does move very quickly through the functions and how to work them so the pause button on my DVD player got a real workout. With the DVD paused I was able to try out some of his tips on my computer while I watched it. This was so helpful!

I recommend this to anyone who is new to editing video. This really helped me understand how easy it is to work the software and also just how much the software will do. By the end of the DVD I had learned things that I didn't even know that it could do. Just remember that he goes quickly and if you want to try it out on the computer along with watching the DVD that you will have to become a pro at pausing the DVD player.

Now that I know how to work Premier Elements to its full potential, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese better watch out. I will soon be turning out better video than anyone in Hollywood!

Also, you can click on any Japanese characters, and it will pronounce them for you very clearly. There is even a quick demonstration on how to pronounce words properly as opposed to the ""foreign"" way.

There are many quizzes as you progress through the hiragana and katakana to help you remember. (Although I also made my own flash cards to assist me - that was enormously helpful.) You will also learn Japanese vocabulary and grammar in an easy-to-understand way.

95,A27PAMABWVQ892,0615179088,"My first experience with Human Japanese was the very first version released. It was a simple program that, while not very attractive to look at, presented Japanese in a simple way that anyone could really understand. When I heard that there was a Human Japanese 2.0, I rushed to get the demo and eventually the full version.

Well, first let me talk about Human Japanese in general. As the name implies, the program tries to teach you Japanese in a ""Human"" way. Without fancy terminology or complicated explanations, but rather doing it in a way that a tutor might teach you. Giving you little hints to remember writing, or making silly acronyms to remember concepts, this program tries to do things like that. It certainly is refreshing to see that kind of teaching being used in a computer program.

Human Japanese 2.0 is broken up into 40 lessons, some focused on grammar while others try to steer the reader towards learning new words and expressions along with writing. At the end of each lesson, there is usually a quiz to test your knowledge of the things learned in that chapter. These can range from small multiple choice quizzes, matching games, and an ""Endless"" type quiz which tests your vocab.

Stuck in between every seven or so lessons are chapters devoted entirely to culture. These small 4-7 page bits are a treat to read. They talk about things like Geography, Prices in Japan, and Bathing among other things. Many more of these for Human Japanese 3.0 would certainly be nice.

The changes from Human Japanese 1 are certainly noticeable at first glance. The interface is changed from the plain white background of 1.0 to a nice background with shades of green and silhouettes of trees. There is now a small search bar on the right side of the screen to look up any vocab term that has appeared in the program. There are also visual aids added to the lessons which, while probably not amazingly helpful, do look nice.

Unfortunately, the changes from Human Japanese 1 are mainly visual. Although there are now 40 lessons, they are mostly just each of the 20 lessons from the previous version split into two lessons. This means that most of the 40 lessons are identical to content in the last version, although they tend to have a bit more meat on them (They are a bit longer, and most have a few extra vocab added).

The interface change is nice, but when making Human Japanese 3.0, I'd urge them to take the time to make up more lessons to further the readers knowledge.",Softwares,2008-04-08,4,positive,first experience human japanese first version released simple program not attractive look presented japanese simple way anyone could really understand heard human japanese rushed get demo eventually full version well first let talk human japanese general name implies program tries teach japanese human way without fancy terminology complicated explanations but rather way tutor might teach giving little hints remember writing making silly acronyms remember concepts program tries things certainly refreshing see kind teaching computer program human japanese broken lessons focused grammar others try steer reader towards learning new words expressions along writing end lesson usually quiz test knowledge things learned chapter range small multiple choice quizzes matching games endless type quiz tests vocab stuck every seven lessons chapters devoted entirely culture small page bits treat read talk things geography prices japan bathing among things many human japanese would certainly nice changes human japanese certainly noticeable first glance interface changed plain white background nice background shades green silhouettes trees small search bar right side screen look vocab term appeared program also visual aids added lessons probably not amazingly helpful look nice unfortunately changes human japanese mainly visual although lessons mostly lessons previous version split two lessons means lessons identical content last version although tend bit meat bit longer extra vocab added interface change nice but making human japanese id urge take time make lessons readers knowledge,0.03242716278430564,negative,21.0,positive,positive

112,AQ02W3BFJPDQ3,0615179088,"Pros
- Introduces Hiragana and Katakana characters by teaching stroke order and pronunciation. The characters are introduced little by little with the help of a quiz, making them much easier to memorize as opposed to learning them all at once.
- Helpful cultural notes are dispersed throughout the software
- Concepts are introduced in an easy to understand, conversational way
- Audio recordings for all Japanese words and phrases

Cons
- Too much vocabulary is introduced at one time
- The vocabulary and concept quizzes are awful. There is no way to choose how many or which words are used in the quiz, it just quizzes you on everything in the chapter at random and indefinitely, making the quiz practically useless for chapters that have a lot of vocabulary, like chapter 28, which has 39 pages.
- There are no exercises whatsoever, only readings that do not require any user input. Because of this, in my opinion, coupled with the horrible quizzes, retention is rendered almost impossible.
- Some concepts are introduced seemingly at random. For example, the particle ""ni"" is introduced in chapter 20, but the particle ""de"" isn't introduced until chapter 35... The problem with this is that both particles are very similar in meaning and it would make a lot more sense to explain both of them at the same time. The result for me was that, for a long time, I incorrectly used ""ni"" in places where ""de"" belonged.
- Verb conjugation isn't explained at all. This to me is the worst part of the software. When the author introduces verbs, he introduces them in their ""-masu"" and ""-te"" forms instead of their dictionary forms. This makes it impossible to know what is actually happening to the verb. For example, when he introduces the verb ""iku"" (to go), he introduces it as ""ikimasu"" and ""itte"", providing no explanation for how ""ikimasu"" conjugates to ""itte"". In fact, the only way to know how this happens is to know that the dictionary form of ""ikimasu"" and ""itte"" is ""iku"", but he doesn't even mention it! There is also no mention of the difference between ""u"" verbs, ""ru"" verbs, and irregular verbs, leaving the user with the impression that the ""-masu"" and ""-te"" forms must simply be committed to memory.
- There are several typos throughout the software, including a typo in one of the Japanese examples.

Other thoughts:
I bought this software as a result of not being able to take the first two intro Japanese classes at my college. I figured that if I used this software, I could opt into the third course and continue from there. My reason for choosing Human Japanese was that I thought it would be much less overwhelming compared to using a textbook. Fortunately, it was. However, if I could go back in time I would definitely choose to use the Genki textbook instead. I was able to opt into the third class, but after going through the first Genki textbook and doing all the exercises, I can say confidently that the Genki textbook isn't that difficult to navigate and far more rewarding and informative.",Softwares,2014-06-20,3,positive,pros introduces hiragana katakana characters teaching stroke order pronunciation characters introduced little little help quiz making much easier memorize opposed learning helpful cultural notes dispersed throughout software concepts introduced easy understand conversational way audio recordings japanese words phrases cons much vocabulary introduced one time vocabulary concept quizzes awful no way choose many words quiz quizzes everything chapter random indefinitely making quiz practically useless chapters lot vocabulary chapter pages no exercises whatsoever readings not require user input opinion coupled horrible quizzes retention rendered almost impossible concepts introduced seemingly random example particle ni introduced chapter but particle de isnt introduced chapter problem particles similar meaning would make lot sense explain time result long time incorrectly ni places de belonged verb conjugation isnt explained worst part software author introduces verbs introduces masu te forms instead dictionary forms makes impossible know actually happening verb example introduces verb iku go introduces ikimasu itte providing no explanation ikimasu conjugates itte fact way know happens know dictionary form ikimasu itte iku but doesnt even mention also no mention difference u verbs ru verbs irregular verbs leaving user impression masu te forms must simply committed memory several typos throughout software including typo one japanese examples thoughts bought software result not able take first two intro japanese classes college figured software could opt third course continue reason choosing human japanese thought would much less overwhelming compared using textbook fortunately however could go back time would definitely choose genki textbook instead able opt third class but going first genki textbook exercises say confidently genki textbook isnt difficult navigate far rewarding informative,-0.06854166666666667,negative,-6.0,negative,positive
113,A2N7IYLK882T6F,0615179088,"I was wanting to learn Japanese, not only to read and speak fluently, buy to be able to talk to myself without anyone knowing what i was saying. With this program, I am able to achieve my wish! This software is so down to earth and friendly, I am surprised I am not talking to an actual person.

I have had this software for a few months now, and when I get a break from my classes, I enjoy the time I spend learning this new language. There is one or two words placed wrongly in a sentence in English, but that is throughout the entire program, while its nothing to ponder on what they just said. You can also report it to Brak, and I am sure they will fix it.

How it works: At the beginning, there is a very mild and friendly introduction, that warms you up to what is coming later. Then, it gives you a tad but of history and few moments to tell you about the writing sysytem. Once that is over, it brings you through Hirigana, the first part, all the while showing you how to write the character and giving you a hint on how to write and how to remember it. Hirigana part 1 is over, now a few pages on the Geography of Japan. Now to Hirigana part 2! Once you have learned Hirigana, they launch you into an amazingly simple and easy introduction to Greetings and what to call things around the home, and explaining how verbs are used. There are 40 chapters, and I am only on 20, which is great, because I am at my own limit, as well as you can, either if you are slow or busy, or fast or in a rush. You need time for this though.

This software is cheap, as in the price, compared to Rosetta Stone. Rosetta Stone just starts flinging out words at you, where you have to figure out how to say it, and what it means, with no training under your belt. Not Human Japanese. I was about to buy a few books on how to speak and read Japanese, but i decided to go on a whim and purchase this software. I do not regret it, and it might have been the best 30 dollars i have ever spent......but i don't keep track. I am definitely going to buy Human Japanese Intermediate once I am done with this one. I am even hoping for them to do a Russian learning software.

Buy this if you are wanting a friendly, self paced software that you can have fun working through, but if you wished to be pushed through learning a language, and like to guess what your saying, go somewhere else. If this was 50 or 100 dollars, i would still buy it, and still say it is the best learning program i have ever used.

I find the brevity of the chapters to be refreshing and easy to work through.

141,A1MMZW6604U9QD,0615179088,"It's hard for me to overstate the help I've gotten from this program in learning Japanese. I'm someone who has never done well with languages in a classroom setting. For some reason, my brain doesn't seem to jive well with the way most foreign language teachers teach. Nothing sinks in, concepts don't 'click', and  after I somehow pass the class, I forget everything.

That's what nearly happened when I took Japanese 100 in college last semester. The class would simply whizz by while I can honestly say I learned next to nothing. Finally, the week of finals, I decided I needed to do something to get up to speed so I'd pass. I used Human Japanese for a few days and learned more than I did during the whole semester. Not only that, but the program helped me to realize just how simple some of the concepts were.

While textbooks tend to describe things in technical-speak that would confuse my understanding even of my native language, Human Japanese does what the name suggests and what the developer promises: it explains Japanese in a personal, human way that does wonders for teaching the new language to someone. I can't tell you how many times I finished learning a new concept and was surprised at just how simple it had been. This program inspires confidence in your ability to learn Japanese. It doesn't take off and leave you in the dust anywhere, ever.

We use Rosetta Stone at school, and I literally hate the program. Never mind its price, Human Japanese is a far superior program for learning the basics of Japanese. The fact that it's much, much more affordable is a huge bonus. Keep in mind, Human Japanese has just released a follow-up program called Human Japanese Intermediate for people who have finished the original and want to delve further into the language.

143,A1W5EC8U1XB8WZ,0615179088,"Alright--this might turn out to be a lengthy review! So if you wanna skip to the grits, I'll let you know exactly where to go.

First, I'll start you off with a little history lesson so that you know where I'm coming from in relation to language. I'm one of those people, one of those thousands of people who simply didn't get language. A second language wouldn't STICK in my brain. As soon as I began to grasp a concept, it would slip. As many Americans do, I was forced (more or less) to take a second language to pass high school. I chose spanish, as it is a money making language in the US. All throughout my spanish career, I struggled. In no offense, I didn't like the language. I didn't care about the culture, I didn't care about anything at all in relation to Spanish except for passing the class. Well, needless to say, while I passed the class, I didn't learn a damn thing. I didn't know why, and assumed it was because I was just one of those thousands of people who just didn't get language. But I do understand language now. It's taken me to my third year of college and a linguistics class to understand WHY I never really learned spanish--and the answer is so simple I could slap myself. It was because I didn't CARE about it! True, you can ""learn"" something that you don't care about--but do you excel? How long does it stick in your brain? Do you remember it or do you actually LEARN it? Ask yourself this!! I realized that I don't give a rats hat about spanish, and that subconsciously affected my learning. But I desperately wanted to become bilingual, so I took a look at a culture and language that I DO care about...

**(This is what you want to read!)
The Human Japanese program is outstanding, amazing, enthralling, captivating, and any other positive ""-ing"" word you can think of. YES, MAC USERS, WE CAN GET IT. Just not here, search it in the Ap store, and you will find it for around 20 bucks (18.99 if my memory hasn't failed yet). Just as the other comments say, it is indeed HUMAN like. He is so warm, simple, and even kind of funny! He cracks a few jokes here and there, and relates tough or questionable subjects to things English speakers can understand. He even gives history lessons so that we can better understand the ""whys"" and the ""hows."" There are animations, a real Japanese woman helping with pronunciation, everything! I absolutely love the program. I admit, I've just start using it--but at the same time, I'm halfway through learning Higarana. And, these things STICK. I don't know how he does it, but he puts his information in a way that really does stay with you. I remember things from pages (the program reads like a warm, friendly book) ages ago. In spanish class, I couldn't remember things we've talked about SENTENCES ago. Best 20 bucks spent.

Now, if you WANT to learn another language, you LIKE Japan and are INTERESTED in the language, with no experience, Human Japanese is the program for you. You have to want to learn it, but when you do, Human Japanese is here to hold your hand. Buy it! I pray that he makes an intermediate and advanced levels, because I don't want to learn from anyone or anything else. :)

Plus it's a lot more fun than reading a book, since there are activities to help the information stick to your brain. It's not just a bunch of memorizing words, in Human Japanese you are actually taught how and when to use the words. Every Japanese word in the book is clickable and will pronounce it for you. Hearing it really helps. I like how the program breaks it up too, you go from learning vocab, to some culture information, to some new Hiragana/Katakana/etc. Doing that keeps it fresh and interesting, and helps a lot because you are slowly introduced into each topic, rather than thrown in and expected to memorize everything. Definitely a great program! Though you can get the digital download for a bit cheaper (I think I paid $19 on the Human Japanese website) if you don't care about having the hard copy of the disc.

I just recently started back with my Japanese studies and started this software over. The software reads more like a book (a good book) and even covering the chapters I had already done before was entertaining. When I first started learning last year I struggled with the kana and was using boring hiragana and katakana workbooks. After switching to Human Japanese I breezed through learning the syllabaries and before I knew it, I was reading Japanese without the aid of romaji. The software slowly introduces hiragana, then katakana, then weens you off of the romaji. I hardly noticed this process happening, so it was the perfect pace for me!

English grammar was never a strong-point of mine. But this software does a great job of explaining the grammar and how it relates to English grammar and breaks it down so that it is easy to understand.

155,A3PWMVKPVPC2VV,0615179088,"This product is fantastic for many reasons. Let me begin by saying that I have been studying Japanese already for six years on my own. So, being already learned from books and other software programs I was a bit hesitant to try another one and have to sit through the motions of basic Japanese BUT the way that they organize this software, it kind of lets you skip around so you're not sitting for hours through these boring automated lessons feverishly clicking the stuff you already know just so you can move on. Human Japanese is pretty open to the user so you can approach Japanese from whatever angle you want. I spent the first week with this software hitting the chapters I wanted to touch up on and found that their way of teaching is actually really comforting just like other reviewers have said.

So much in fact that I am now just going back over the stuff I 'already knew' and am constantly getting pleasantly surprised by the way that they explain those things. Like it makes even MORE sense now.

The writing style is calm with some mild jovial points that catch your attention, really it IS as if you are sitting there with a Japanese person and an American person, both fluent in the language and they are EXPLAINING it to you, point for point, making connections with English that really - I haven't even seen referenced in many books I own and I'm up to about 35.

Overall, this is a great product for learning the basics of Japanese to an extent that allows basic communication, especially speech. The integrated audio files demonstrating pronunciation are a life saver and help demonstrate proper pitch accent to keep your own speech clear and comprehensible.

There's a lot of good vocabulary and grammar, and at the end of each chapter there are quizzes to help you judge how well you retained the material and also to practice. My only complaint is that the quizzes are often very large, making it difficult to learn smaller groups of vocabulary at a time, and that you are not able to generate custom, cumulative quizzes to test your knowledge overall.

Something I thought was lacking was the writing aspects. While the introduction to Hiragana is great, the material on Katakana is more stretched out, and many foreign words are first written in Hiragana because of your lack of knowledge in a certain chapter. Additionally, the Hiragana chapter has additional memory exercises, whereas the Katakana is limited to a matching game which isn't a particularly good way to memorize them. For this reason, I still haven't.

And finally, in my introductory college textbook, even a few kanji are introduced per chapter as the book goes on. I'm not saying this product should have hundreds of kanji to teach, but I feel introducing some of the more basic ones would have helped.

166,A3309IEQSU5WF9,0615179088,"This is one of the best tools for complete beginners to Japanese. Human Japanese will teach you how to write the kana, why the Japanese writing system is the way it is, as well as basic grammar and about 1800 words/sentences (with good quality audio recorded by native speakers). Everything is explained clearly in plain English and I found it fun to use. I only have a few minor complaints:

-Human Japanese does not mention pitch/word accent. While Japanese does not have a ""stressed"" accent like English does, syllables can be low or high in pitch (similar to how our voice rises when we ask a question in English). However, the pitch accent is very obvious in the recordings, so as long as you model your pronunciation after the audio, you'll know how to say the words properly.
-This software briefly mentions whispered vowels, but only for ""su"" and not other vowels. When vowels come between certain consonants, they are often whispered. Again, if you copy the audio's pronunciation you'll be fine.
-The search functionality included in the software is helpful, but it only searches for key words, not the entire text. It would be nice if it showed all instances of a word.
-Another complaint is that words and sentences must mainly be learned through memorization. They are presented in a list format that is clickable with audio. There are short quizzes and games available to practice, but it would be cool if they made this part of the learning more interactive and fun, especially since this is software. The advantage of the list format is that it gets right to the point, so if you just want to learn words quickly without going through a bunch of animations, you can. It's more like an interactive textbook with good explanations.
-Additionally, since Human Japanese is a beginner course, it only gives an introduction to kanji and doesn't cover all the grammar found in a regular textbook. Its purpose is to give you the confidence that you can study Japanese, even by yourself! For what it teaches, the price is right.

It's easy to be overwhelmed by Japanese as a beginner because it is completely backwards from English. Textbooks often assume that you already know how to write the kana and they don't explain the basics in much detail. It's a shame that most textbooks aren't suited for self-learning beginners, but that's where Human Japanese excels. After finishing this course, you'll have a very solid foundation and be able to jump into any popular Japanese textbook series.

If any of my friends ask me what they should use to start learning Japanese, I'm definitely going to recommend this. It's suitable and friendly for just about anyone with an electronic device. I don't think I can say that about the majority of language materials I own. I really hope this company makes more advanced levels, as well as versions for other languages. I'm also trying to learn some Chinese right now and a Human Chinese would be wonderful!

Instead of reading reviews, just go to the Human Japanese website and try it out for yourself. There is a demo available for your browser as well as a downloadable version for Windows. It goes through 8-12 chapters depending on the demo, and there are 40 chapters total, so you should be able to get a good feel for the full version. Human Japanese is also available for the Mac on the Mac App Store, as well as the iPhone, Android, and Windows 7 phones. For the phones there is also a free ""Lite"" version, which I downloaded prior to writing this review. The phone versions seem to be the same as the PC/Mac ones. I haven't used the phone app much, but it lists the same 40 lessons and the first few chapters have the same exact text and audio. It's obviously a bit easier to read the text on my computer screen than on my phone, but the formatting looks fine.

If you want to learn through software and you've thought about trying Rosetta Stone, get this instead. It's much better ""bang for your buck"" than Rosetta Stone and you'll have a more thorough understanding of how the Japanese language works. It doesn't cover as much vocabulary as Rosetta Stone or use pictures, but there are so many other cheaper (and more efficient) methods to build vocabulary, such as Anki, a free flashcard software, with user-shared flashcard decks (some even include pictures and audio).

Overall, 9/10.

If you are looking for an audio program, too, I really like Michel Thomas' Beginners Japanese course. Similar to Human Japanese, it will give you a nice start to speaking and basic grammar. I think it would complement this software well.

167,A3IXP5VS847GE5,0615179088,"My situation: Both my 8 y.o. son and I are learning Japanese together.  I have taken one year of Japanese in college, my husband speaks some, and we have access to native speakers.  That said, mostly I am a beginner needing a simple, clear, and accurate text that we can use for self-study.

We are using the i-pod touch application of Human Japanese (which is very handy to carry around in your pocket and use to practice pronunciation and what-not where ever you happen to be.)

Reasons this software stands out:

  -I LOVE that I can instantly hear the pronunciation of any Japanese words or sentences simply by touching them.  Japanese writing is introduced immediately, so this is very helpful in building your reading skills and  pronunciation at the same time, which is the only effective way to do it.  This is a HUGE improvement over my college text books, where one has to pop in separate audio C.D.'s to hear the lesson's vocabulary.  With Human Japanese you see it and hear it together all at the same time, and it's easy to access.

  -I love that the hiragana and katakana are animated, so you can see how it is drawn simply by touching it.

  - The explanations and layout are easy and enjoyable to read.  My son enjoys reading the lessons to me in the car, and is not intimidated or confused by it.
It's clear this is someone who knows from experience what would be useful to an English speaker learning Japanese (and is no doubt creating the text he WISHED he had when learning.)

My son and I have been taking a very leisurely pace and are on chapter 10 after about 5 months.  This is mostly due to wanting to get the kana down solidly, and having the limitations of an 8 y.o. attention span.  We aren't doing tons of talking yet, but the delay is worth having a comfortable reading relationship with the kana.  I have skimmed ahead and the other chapters seem well done.

I do find it helpful to do some supplementing:

 We could not remember all the hiragana and katakana characters so easily, so we made our own charts, and would quiz ourselves by drawing the characters in the air, until we could do them from memory.  I highly suggest printing out two blank 10 by 5 box grids (plus one drawn in for ""n"") and making a hiragana and katakana chart for yourself.  You can easily print out a chart from the web for reference, but making your own really helps the memory.  We have used practice print outs from a Japanese website for kids, that are fabulous, with cute pictures for the characters that teach you simple words at the same time.  They have corresponding Hiragana and Katakana charts.  The site is kids dot nifty dot com fowardslash study forwardslash index dot htm
The chart with the yellow background is the hiragana, the mint-green is the katakana, and the pictures with the pink ice cream and candy are the worksheets.

This, however, is only to supplement: Human Japanese will teach you what need to know about the characters...this just gives extra practice to those who need to write it themselves, and see it all in a chart in one spot.

For the numbers chapter I found myself wanting to know what the Kanji for the numbers are, and looking that up on the web.  I wish it had been included in the lesson, even if we weren't technically covering Kanji yet.  Same thing for the days of the week.  I found helpful info. fairly easily online for this [...], and also a more useful way of understanding the number units ""man"" (10,000) and ""oku"" (100,000,000) by showing them grouped by 4 places instead of three (shift that comma over so you get 1,0000 and 1,0000,0000.)  This is a small thing, but very useful for understanding what is going on with the numbers, and I'm surprised it wasn't presented that way.

Despite me wanting to supplement here and there, this is a great program to use as the backbone of your beginning study.

183,A3NO15FKC1JA1R,0615179088,"So far, I'm on chapter 4 and really like the program. I can't believe it's only $25 when programs like Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur cost more than  $300. It's well thought-out, with interesting tidbits on how the Japanese language compares to English in terms of numbers of syllables, writing, how it evolved from its initial use of Chinese characters. Very interesting stuff. The tone is conversational, as if you were learning from a live teacher who also has a sense of humor. For example, here's an excerpt from chapter 3: Hiragana:

""If Japanese used only Hiragana and Katakana, it would be one of the simplest writing systems in the world. Alas, the picture is a bit more complicated than that. See, when Hiragana was invented, Chinese characters didn't just roll over and die. Keep in mind that Kanji were associated with wealth, power, and education. So for centuries, most of the people who had those things continued to write extensively in Kanji.""

It's hard to be bored with stuff like that.

Human Japanese is different because it's engaging. You can click on words to hear the pronunciations, but you can see the romanized spelling of Japanese words and/or the kana and/or the kanji. This is what language-learning should entail--seeing, hearing, and speaking (which you do to yourself, of course). I only wish that Human Japanese had a recording function, like the ""Talk Now!"" series does, which allows you to record your pronunciation and play it back. Then you can determine whether your pronunciation is off or spot-on.

After only a couple months of (not very diligent) study, I've already learned to read and write in Hiragana, some Katakana, and make basic sentences as well as greetings and the like. It's been a very enjoyable experience, and it's the one part of ""schoolwork"" I always enjoy. The whole thing is presented in a very clean and organized matter, along with voice clips to aid in pronunciation.

185,AK59ZZJJ1S94H,0615179088,"I used this program as somewhat of a litmus test, in the sense that I didn't want to go ahead and spend a lot of money on a Japanese textbook before I knew if I could be capable of learning it. After my experience with Human Japanese I feel more confident to go forth with my studies, and spend a little more money on more advanced resources.

My biggest thing, is that I feel like I got my monies worth out of this product, unlike a lot of costly programs currently on the market. For 25 bucks you get 40 chapters of dense vocab and grammar notes, along with cute cultural notes. My only criticism would be that for certain chapters its difficult to remember the vocab with it just listed. For the body section for example, it would have been easier to understand it if he had some sort of body diagram and listed the parts on a picture of the body. I would have also been really happy if instead of listing the hiragana or katakana he showed the kanji of the word to the side, so I won't have to go back and re-learn them. Despite my nitpicks, I still enjoyed this unique program, and I would recommend it to others.

(On a side note) After finishing Human Japanese, I felt confident enough to invest in an online textbook with a heftier price tag.

186,A3TTDEJRZ92ME1,0615179088,"Before buying Human Japanese, I had tried Rosetta Stone Japanese. What a WASTE of time!
To me, this is simply the best place to start your Japanese learning. It gives you a solid foundation in the basics of Japanese writing, grammar, sentence structure, culture, and gets you over many of the hurdles that beginning Japanese learners face.

This product is an amazing deal, in my opinion. For such a low price, you learn so much, you enjoy learning it, and you actually remember what they teach. This software is like a favorite, enjoyable book that you just can't put down.

Some of my favorite features of this program:
- Awesome cultural tidbits and information about Japan and geography!
- Useful vocabulary and phrases and a way to look up any Japanese word that the program uses!
- A warm, inviting approach that makes it HUMAN and not like a textbook.
- The tech support is amazing. The creators are really nice, always trying to improve their software and bring it to new places and levels. They respond immediately.

What's in it for you?
- If you don't know hiragana and katakana, you'll learn how to write it, stroke order, stroke number, and little tips to remember how to write the kana well. If you're like me and already know it, it can give you a nice refresher course!
- Culture, history, geography, and more presented in a way that keeps you interested.
- Nice, clear photographs and clear male and female speaking voices.
- Dialogue that helps you learn to recognize speech patterns, sentence patterns, vocabulary, and learn to read hiragana and katakana at the rate they are speaking, instead of relying on romaji.
- Easy to navigate chapters and reviews. Reviews that include flash cards and the very helpful vocabulary quizzes.
- Compliments books and other learning methods well, and is a great, easy to use reference for anything you need a refresher on - like wa and ga, or what that darn word for kitchen is.

This product is simply excellent. It is a MUST buy. Don't believe me? Try the demo on their website.
I was skeptical, too, but after trying the demo I was absolutely HOOKED.
Top 10 Reviews put it at number 5 out of 11, but in my opinion, it belongs much higher on the list!

188,AFL7RQCOPJ0JV,0615179088,"I bought this because of the price and the reviews.  I had taken part of a semester of Japanese at the city college and boy was I disappointed.  I have a good deal of language learning experience and I just felt like the teacher I had was making it way too complicated (although I think she was trying to make it easier in her defense).  It really isn't all that difficult of complex a language.  It's simply mysterious because of the writing system and grammar differences.

Here's my advice.  Take the hiragana and write down the first ten characters.  Repeat repeat repeat until you can do it from memory.  Then add ten more.  Repeat procedure.  You will have all of your hiragana and katakana down in no time.  Honestly, a couple of days would suffice if you really want to learn it quickly.  Once you have that down, you will feel like you have your feet on the ground and the rest will not be so scary.  If you would like to practice, you can google ""hiragana practice"" or something like that and find quite a few little quizzes or games, etc.  That's a good way to keep it current.

Anyway, Human Japanese is exactly that, human.  It's not going to treat you like a robot student and try to program you with information.  Expect to be told digestable amounts of information.  It will obviously be quite different than English, so just accept it and move on.  Things will start to come together before long and you will find there are some things you actually understand.  This is encouraging.  Now and then, bits and pieces of cultural knowledge will come up to break up the lessons and keep it from getting boring.

If you're just getting into Japanese, this is the best $24.95 you'll ever spend in your learning endeavors. It's essentially a sensei-in-a-box.

The writing style is genuine and interesting, and it almost feels like the conversation of a close friend. It compels one to read further and takes away any sense of learning as a chore.

201,A2R3CJCDNC1KO1,0669524425,"This program and the other Earobics titles are clearly designed for North American users.

This is a shame because most of the activities work quite well.

However as a previous user mentioned - there are still af few glitches in there - thankfully not many.

What is more problematic is the English vs American accents.

Some of the differences are very frustrating for the kids, and leaves them stranded on the same level, unable to progress.

In the Fireman sounds game - the short vowels u and o sound almost identical.

For English speakers (UK, Australia, NZ, Sth Africa etc) these sounds are very different.
with the short 'u' sound clearly being pronounced 'uh' as in 'cup' or 'but'
and the short 'o' sound pronounced as 'o' as in 'cot' or 'orange'

However the Nth Amercian pronounciation of the short 'o' sounds very close to the 'u'/'uh', and comes out sounding somewhere between 'ah' and 'awe'.
So instead of 'cot' it sounds like 'c-ah-t' ... which is ok in the word recognition as there are the surrounding letters to help with the sound interpretation.
However in the individual short vowel sound recognition - it's quite hard and confusing for the kids, as it's clearly very different to what they learn in school English classes.

Similarly for the Pengiun game where there are sounds syllables given for words which are just confusing for the kids' spelling.
eg lemon ... instead of being sounded out as le-mon ... is sounded out as le-min
chicken ... instead of being sounded out as chi-cken ... is sounded out as chick-in
kitchen ... instead of being sounded out as kit-chen ... is sounded out as kit-chin

Finally the Hippo - find the mismatched sound in the sequence game, has very similar problems to the o/u issues above, along with r/l, with the kids getting stranded on a level unable to progress. At times, even as an adult who is well versed in accents - I cant hear the difference between the ruh/luh/rah/lah. The audio is also quite clipped short ... so this makes it even more difficult to determine what sound is being said.

Summary:
The Pirate/Parrot word/syllable matching games and the Luck Duck sound/syllable/word recognition games don't seem to suffer from these issues.

The beginner & intermediate levels of the Fireman sound recognition game are also good. With the English/American accent confusions only arising in the advanced level games.

Apart from the pronounciation issues - the Penguin game works well too.

Probably the most frustrating one is the Hippo game as the kids can easily get stuck on each of 8 the beginner tasks without progressing at all. Any background noise can make it impossible to hear the subtle sound differences, which are not familiar to non-American accent speakers.

***
The games are repetitive by nature, so can become a bit boring. So offer some kind of incentives to get them thru it. We did the program over the school spring break - getting thru all the beginner & intermediate levels within 2 weeks, except the Hippo, which I'm considering abandonning if the higher levels' audio isn't clearer as it's too frustrating.",Softwares,2011-10-12,3,positive,program earobics titles clearly designed north american users shame activities work quite well however previous user mentioned still af glitches thankfully not many problematic english vs american accents differences frustrating kids leaves stranded level unable progress fireman sounds game short vowels u sound almost identical english speakers uk australia nz sth africa etc sounds different short u sound clearly pronounced uh cup but short sound pronounced cot orange however nth amercian pronounciation short sounds close uuh comes sounding somewhere ah awe instead cot sounds caht ok word recognition surrounding letters help sound interpretation however individual short vowel sound recognition quite hard confusing kids clearly different learn school english classes similarly pengiun game sounds syllables given words confusing kids spelling eg lemon instead sounded lemon sounded lemin chicken instead sounded chicken sounded chickin kitchen instead sounded kitchen sounded kitchin finally hippo find mismatched sound sequence game similar problems ou issues along rl kids getting stranded level unable progress times even adult well versed accents cant hear difference ruhluhrahlah audio also quite clipped short makes even difficult determine sound said summary pirateparrot wordsyllable matching games luck duck soundsyllableword recognition games dont seem suffer issues beginner intermediate levels fireman sound recognition game also good englishamerican accent confusions arising advanced level games apart pronounciation issues penguin game works well probably frustrating one hippo game kids easily get stuck beginner tasks without progressing background noise make impossible hear subtle sound differences not familiar nonamerican accent speakers games repetitive nature become bit boring offer kind incentives get thru program school spring break getting thru beginner intermediate levels within weeks except hippo im considering abandonning higher levels audio isnt clearer frustrating,-0.05529661016949153,negative,-1.0,negative,positive

However the Nth Amercian pronounciation of the short 'o' sounds very close to the 'u'/'uh', and comes out sounding somewhere between 'ah' and 'awe'.
So instead of 'cot' it sounds like 'c-ah-t' ... which is ok in the word recognition as there are the surrounding letters to help with the sound interpretation.
However in the individual short vowel sound recognition - it's quite hard and confusing for the kids, as it's clearly very different to what they learn in school English classes.

Similarly for the Pengiun game where there are sounds syllables given for words which are just confusing for the kids' spelling.
eg lemon ... instead of being sounded out as le-mon ... is sounded out as le-min
chicken ... instead of being sounded out as chi-cken ... is sounded out as chick-in
kitchen ... instead of being sounded out as kit-chen ... is sounded out as kit-chin

Finally the Hippo - find the mismatched sound in the sequence game, has very similar problems to the o/u issues above, along with r/l, with the kids getting stranded on a level unable to progress. At times, even as an adult who is well versed in accents - I cant hear the difference between the ruh/luh/rah/lah. The audio is also quite clipped short ... so this makes it even more difficult to determine what sound is being said.

Summary:
The Pirate/Parrot word/syllable matching games and the Luck Duck sound/syllable/word recognition games don't seem to suffer from these issues.

The beginner & intermediate levels of the Fireman sound recognition game are also good. With the English/American accent confusions only arising in the advanced level games.

Apart from the pronounciation issues - the Penguin game works well too.

Probably the most frustrating one is the Hippo game as the kids can easily get stuck on each of 8 the beginner tasks without progressing at all. Any background noise can make it impossible to hear the subtle sound differences, which are not familiar to non-American accent speakers.

***
The games are repetitive by nature, so can become a bit boring. So offer some kind of incentives to get them thru it. We did the program over the school spring break - getting thru all the beginner & intermediate levels within 2 weeks, except the Hippo, which I'm considering abandonning if the higher levels' audio isn't clearer as it's too frustrating.",Softwares,2011-10-12,3,positive,program earobics titles clearly designed north american users shame activities work quite well problematic english vs american accents differences frustrating kids leaves stranded level unable progress review earobics step but also applies earobics titles fireman sounds game short vowels u sound almost identical english speakers uk australia nz sth africa etc sounds different short u sound clearly pronounced uh cup but short sound pronounced cot orange however nth amercian pronounciation short sounds close uuh comes sounding somewhere ah awe instead cot sounds caht ok word recognition surrounding letters help sound interpretation however individual short vowel sound recognition quite hard confusing kids clearly different learn school english classes similarly pengiun game sounds syllables given words confusing kids spelling eg lemon instead sounded lemon sounded lemin chicken instead sounded chicken sounded chickin kitchen instead sounded kitchen sounded kitchin finally hippo find mismatched sound sequence game similar problems ou issues along rl kids getting stranded level unable progress times even adult well versed accents cant hear difference ruhluhrahlah audio also quite clipped short makes even difficult determine sound said summary pirateparrot wordsyllable matching games luck duck soundsyllableword recognition games dont seem suffer issues beginner intermediate levels fireman sound recognition game also good englishamerican accent confusions arising advanced level games apart pronounciation issues penguin game works well probably frustrating one hippo game kids easily get stuck beginner tasks without progressing background noise make impossible hear subtle sound differences not familiar nonamerican accent speakers games repetitive nature become bit boring offer kind incentives get thru program school spring break getting thru beginner intermediate levels within weeks except hippo im considering abandonning higher levels audio isnt clearer frustrating,-0.049926900584795326,negative,-1.0,negative,positive

I write as a sole proprietor who has been using Office 365 Enterprise for half a year.  I installed Office 2013 RTM (i.e. final version) about a month earlier than the official release in late January 2013.  My review will answer 1) why and who should upgrade to Office 2013 and 2) which version (Home & Business, Pro, Office 365 Home Premium, Small Business or Enterprise) to choose.

For Q1 (who should and why upgrade), my short answer is: upgrade if you are: a) using a touch computer; b) you own several computers and use all of them to edit the same documents; c) you are running on a slow computer and wants some extra speed.  Otherwise there is no need to upgrade from 2007/2010.  2003 users will have to decide whether they want to make the switch to Ribbon.

1A - Using a touch computer
I own a Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro, a Windows 8 Pro tablet.  Office 2013 automatically recognizes the touchscreen and increases the spacing between icons for me.  Frankly the increased spacing is not much use on my 11.6 inch display as mis-clicks are still frequent.  I still resort to the built-in pen for clicking the small icons (Save, undo etc).

More importantly, the new version supports gestures such as pinch to zoom and flicking the screen to scroll.  This, together with Windows 8 Pro, make touch experience almost bearable on a PC.

Of course, to truly take advantage of Office 2013's touch function, you also need Windows 8.  The on-screen keyboard in Windows 8 is simply better than the one in Windows 7.  The most important improvement is the maximize icon next to the X button of the keyboard.  Press it, and the keyboard becomes ""one with the taskbar"".  The app will not occupy the space beneath the keyboard and make itself inaccessible (because the keyboard floats above it).

Word now supports a Reader mode, which is HUGELY useful and makes me want to convert all my ePub to word documents.  The idea is simple: Word reflows the text to single column/double columns while maintaining certain formatting like italic, fonts, highlighting etc and discarding others (tabs, line spacing for example).  This is similar to what we experience from other eReaders (Amazon Kindle, ePub readers etc).  The great thing about reading document in Word 2013 is that you can save your annotation directly on the file - there is no need to worry about syncing annotation.  Contrast this to reading ePub - each software saves its own annotation file that cannot be easily read by another software.

1B - Multiple computers, one document
Having multiple computers is both a blessing and a curse.  Nothing beats turning off your office computer and take an early leave, knowing that whatever you failed to complete can be finished at home.  However it is a nightmare to learn that the document (or the newest version of it) is not available when you arrive at home.

There are many ways to transfer files from office to home, from the tedious (USB, manual or software assisted) to the care-free (dropbox automatic sync).  Your organization may or may not allow USB drives (for good reasons).  Dropbox requires administrative privilege which 99% of the working force do not have.  With Office 2013 you have a third option - save to your own Skydrive.  If you purchase the non-subscription version, you get 7GB space of Skydrive, Office 365 Home Premium gives you 27GB.  For the business version, storage depends on the base subscription and add-on plans.  Skydrive is like a USB stick that connects to your computer through the Internet.  You can create folders, save files, read files, delete files just as you would on a USB stick.  The difference is that it is always available as long as you have connection to the Internet.

To save to Skydrive, you must first have a Microsoft Live account.  If you have a Hotmail/outlook.com email account, you already have one.  You can also register a Live Account with any email you own (gmail Yahoo university mail).  You then login to this Live account from within Office, you only need to do it once for each computer, and you can do it in Excel/Word/etc.  After you have logged in, you can Save the document to Skydrive by pressing the icon linking to your skydrive, and you will be prompted with your Skydrive's folder structure - just as what you would see if you were to save on C drive.  To open a file, choose Open, then press the icon to your skydrive, and viola - your file is there.  A little icon called Office Upload Assistant on bottom right area next to the clock (the notification area) tells you whether all documents have been uploaded.

I also like the fact that opening Word 2013 shows you a Welcome screen with built-in templates AND YOUR OWN TEMPLATES (provided they are saved in Skydrive/locally).  No longer do you need to go through layers of folders before finding the template for Invoice etc.  You can also ""pin"" your favorite templates so that they are one-click away from being created.  You can of course still create new documents from templates the way you would in 2007/2010.

1C - Performance
Performance is BIG thing nowadays.  Finally Microsoft saw the need to reduce the footprints of its software and make them more suitable for the ""average"" machines.  It used to be the case that business machines are evaluated by how many Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word can be opened simultaneously while running on Windows Vista!

Having used the RAM-eating Office 2007 and the atrociously slow Office 2010, Office 2013 breathes new life to my 4 years old Dell Latitude E4200 (running on an ultra-low voltage dual-core Penryn processor).  I used to uncheck Outlook when I re-installed Office 2007/2010 because they start up painfully slowly.  The speed of Outlook 2013 is almost tolerable (about 7 seconds).  Outlook 2013 also does not cause my notebook to stutter.

The re-sizing on Word has also been improved.  It no longer draws accurate snapshots of the document as you zoom.  Instead it ""blurs"" the document as you zoom, and after you have settled on the zoom level, it draws a final, accurate snapshot.  It may not seem much, but coming from a computer-engineering background, I suspect this reduces CPU workload (and thus energy use) significantly.

Saving, opening, and switching between Ribbon tabs now feel instant even on my crappy 4 years-old laptop.  On my new Samsung tablet (sporting the newest Intel processor), starting Word is instant and outlook takes a mere 2 seconds to show.  The whole experience is very much like using an iPad, where every app loads instantaneously.

New features
I can only comment on Word, Onenote and Outlook 2013, which I use daily.  I will let my more knowledgeable fellow reviewers comment on the rest.

Word 2013
New features include the reader mode, touch-icons, touch gestures (mentioned above).

Track Changes is now infinitely more useful as it shows comments like a conversation.  The new Office Store allows you to install third-party apps (such as Merriam-Webster Dictionaries) to increase functionality.  You no longer need to ""hunt"" for plug-ins as you would for all previous versions.

You may or may not need the add pictures from an online location function.  The ability to embed YouTube video is also of dubious use - I prefer saving the youtube video offline, convert it and send it as an attachment to the word document.  This way my client won't ring me at 2am complaining they cannot view the clip (whether it is due to their connection to YouTube or some technical problem I do not care to solve), but this is just me.

The much-touted PDF manipulation is trash.  It seems that whatever PDF file I open using Word 2013, formatting is heavily messed up.  Apparently Microsoft tries to convert PDF to DOCX first before you can do any meaningful operation.  You are better off with a software that treats PDF as a PDF, such as the cheap but excellent PDF-XCHANGE software suites.

OneNote 2013
I could not be bothered to compare the feature sets between OneNote MX (free with Windows 8) and OneNote 2013.  It suffices to note that MX has fewer features but a more touch-centric control.
OneNote still does not get the degree of formatting control like Word.  You cannot make multi-layered lists or format text (and change formatting) using an umbrella category (like the Body, Heading 1, Heading 2).  Still, I enjoy jotting notes with OneNote much more than with Word.  Lists just indent to the proper place EVERY SINGLE TIME and there is no need to deal with page breaks.

I cannot think of any new features that are worth mentioning.  Onenote 2010 already had some sort of integration with the predecessor to Skydrive (called Live Drive).  The auto-correct still does not correct Recognise to Recognize etc (as Word 2013) does.  You can still add Online picture as you do in Word 2013.  There is also a new helper software that sits on the Taskbar and help you get screen capture quicker.  I always turn off the helper software because it adds unnecessary complexity to my taskbar.

Outlook 2013
Microsoft has not gone enough to change Outlook 2013.  Just as 2007/2010, it is extremely difficult to change account settings such as whether to download headers only or full text (with or without attachments).  The data file (OST or PST) still reside in the elusive place of C:\User\(user name)\AppData instead of your own ""My Document"" folder.  Sure you will forget to back that up as you re-install windows?  You also cannot see all emails using an ""Unified Inbox"" as you would with a 2-year old android phone/iPhone without using a script (search unified inbox vba if you really want to know)

Outlook has always struggled to find a proper interface.  I still recall using Outlook 2000 and being greeted with a Today's screen which shows some of my unread emails and upcoming appointments in extremely small fonts.  Outlook 2013 is better, when you start it shows you the Inbox, and you can quickly switch to appointments/contacts from the bottom left huge icons.

One new feature is integration with Facebook/other social networks.  The idea is to merge your contacts with Facebook's contacts.  I only connected about 20% of my friends because Outlook doesn't know Charles Jeremy Moore in outlook is really Charles Moore on Facebook.  You can of course manually link them as you could in the People app in Windows 8, but I cannot be bothered.

Assuming you have linked facebook contacts with Outlook, you can see a snapshot of your friend's profile while reading his email.  Useful?  I doubt it.  It is not often the case that your business associates will write something you absolutely must know business-wise (gossiping is another matter).  If there is some blogs/feeds you must read, the recommended course is to setup an RSS feed and read it regularly.  Stumbling upon someone's relationship status only distracts you from the current work.

It may or may not be a new feature, but pinning Outlook 2013 to your taskbar allows you to create tasks/appointments quickly.  Right-click the icon (not left click) and you will be greeted with a short-cut for New Appointment/Email/Contact/Task/Meeting.  What is best is that using any of the above will not launch Outlook 2013, not the whole program at least.  It is extremely handy for adding new appointments etc when you are talking on phone.  The ability to quickly add appointment from Outlook 2013 is one of the reasons I ditched Google in favour of my Office 365 Exchange account for storing calendars and contacts.  (note: Outlook 2013 cannot sync with Gmail's Exchange ActiveSync as of now, Outlook blames Google for not having the newest Exchange version).
WARNING: do not use the New Email function from the right click menu.  After you have typed your email, it is stored at the Outbox but NOT send out.  You have to launch Outlook to send it.  I cannot understand what Microsoft is thinking...

2 - Comparison
I have been using Office 365 to host my business email address and website for half a year, so I am familiar with the subscription model.

Feature-wise Office Pro and Office 365 is the same (but note the difference in Skydrive storage).  Simple math tells us that the price for Office Pro equates 4 years of Office 365.  The catch for purchasing Office Pro is that you are limited to 1 PC while Office 365 covers 5.  If you own more than 1 device, Office 365 is a no-brainer, or so it seems.

The reason why I gave Office Pro 5 stars while Office 365 Home Premium 3 stars is solely based on Price alone.  If you are a sole proprietor/small business, you are better-off with the Office 365 business plans (as I am subscribing).  If you are a Home User, as the name Home Premium suggest, I make the following assumptions: 1) your company pays for the office licence in your work computer(s) and 2) you do not have more than 1 home computer that needs Office.  Under this assumption the 5 PC advantage practically falls away.  The remaining question is whether you will upgrade in 4 years and whether the extra storage matters.

4 years is a bit longer than 1 product cycle (see 2003 - 2007-2010-2013).  If you will buy/subscribe Office 2016/2017 (if there is one) when it is released, then subscribing to Home Premium will present better value.  If you will skip one product cycle (i.e. skipping 2016/2017 and purchase 2020/2021), then Office Pro is better value.  I think most home users can afford to lag behind more than 1 product cycle.  New products are not always better, often the new features are useless to a home user and the new interface just spells frustration.

I think Office 365 HP is only appeal to users who match every criterion below:
1) You need Outlook/Access/Publisher
2) You have more than 1 computer
3) You plan to receive the next Office as it becomes available
4) You are not benefitted by Office 365 business versions

Regarding 1) above, most home users need Word/Excel/Powerpoint only, and their needs are well served by the cheaper Home versions.  Please note that if you do not use Outlook now, you probably won't need it in the future.  It is an overkill for checking gmail etc.  Access and Publisher require you to sit down and learn, possibly taking 1 month each before you fully appreciate their use and advantage over Excel/Word.  There is no point in going for Office Pro or Office HP just to get all software and be ""future-proof"" if Office Home Student/Home Business is good enough.

If you are willing to pay so much for the extra software (Outlook/Publisher/Access), but doesn't receive a free licence from your company, chances are that you work at a SMB.  SMBs stand to benefit A LOT from Office 365 business (see below), and even though you may not implement all the features, Office 365 business is still worth considering.

Office 365 Home Premium is expensive compared with Office 365 Enterprise.  At $20/Month Office 365 Enterprise gives you all Office software, your own exchange email account, Sharepoint and Lync (basic) servers.  The website shows Office Professional Plus 2010, but you can download Office 2013 RTM from TechNet and use your Office 365 login name to get the software running.  That was how I got Office 2013 a month earlier than the general public.

I wish only to add that regardless of whether you use Office 365 HP or Office 365 Ent, Office Web App is trash.  The idea of being able to edit document from a web-browser (running on an iPad maybe) is attractive, but unrealistic.  The reasons are: 1) Web App only supports DocX etc formats, but not the old formats; 2) more importantly, formatting is often MESSED UP when you use Web App.

More coming: the benefit of having your own exchange account and more importantly sharepoint server (in the coming week) and why it is much better value to sole proprietor/small

So, if you have multiple email accounts, you'll either need to look through multiple inboxes for your mail, or write a rule to direct all your accounts into a new .pst you'll create.  I did this, but that's not without its problems, too.  Unbelievable.  I like POP email because it resides on my local machine, and can be easily searched.  It's obvious Microsoft, in this version, wants you to use IMAP, which does no more than show you a picture of what's already in your web based email accounts.  The argument is that IMAP allows you to check email from multiple devices, but with POP you can still leave email on the server by simply checking a box (Gmail, etc).  And, IMAP makes searching for a key word among all your emails impossible.  I like the 5 machine licenses, but would rather have Outlook 2007 than this.

281,A2A6LPDHNCPYA5,0763855553,"I thought I would upgrade my Office 2007 package to Office 365 Home since Office 2007 is at end of life. Big mistake.

I downloaded Office 365 on a brand new computer from Dell. Went through all updates to Windows 10 to make sure I was at the latest and greatest release. Mapped network drives and verified I could access files on the NAS (Network Attached Server) I have on our home network. So far so good. This is when I installed Office 365; note that Office 2007 not yet installed on this machine. I have 3 other PCs, one of which is an old laptop (7 years) which this new pc is to replace. All of the others PCs are running Windows 10, Office 2007 and dta stored on the NAS working just fine.

Office 365 installs fine and I of course check for and install all Office updates. I am able to open files from the NAS but every time I do so I get the protected view warning that documents downloaded from the internet could be unsafe. Not wanting to have to click enable for that warning every time for the rest of my life for any file that I open from the NAS I went to make my NAS location a Trusted Location. But when I follow Microsoft's instructions on how to do that I get the ""cannot do this for security reasons error"". Sigh - Microsoft has now made it irritating and unnecessarily complex to use my home network. SO I look on the web and find this is not an uncommon problem but the homebrew solutions out there involve editing the registry or other equally arcane solutions involving trusting someone on the web's incantation to fix it - ""really it will, just trust me"".

Next step - call Microsoft Tech support. I'll bet you can guess how that turned out. I quickly exhaust the minuscule competence of the first level support, but to be fair all I really expected was for them to be able to send me to someone who had competence beyond check the power cord and on button.  So I get a scheduled time for Tier 2 to call me back . Fair enough. I get a call from Tier 2 asking me what is the issue. So all the work I spent explaining the issue to the first help person was wasted. This would prove to be a recurring theme since I would have to start all over with each new person. So this expert asked to take remote control of my machine. OK. Then they turned off protected view entirely, which meant I would be eliminating security for the entire internet. Not what I needed. So took the time to step her through the process of Trusted Locations and explained I just wanted to trust my NAS, not the entire hacking community. She was able to see the error message, but had no idea how to troubleshoot this. Fair enough - I expected that she would pass me on to the next tier and to a technician  who specialized in the area. But  instead she asked to take a few minutes to confer with her team. OK - I appreciate someone who wants to figure things out and is willing to consult with teammates. A little while later she comes back and wants to try everything but this time as an administrator. Good idea but doesn't work. Then here is the stunner - she asked if I could call an IT person. I thought she meant a Microsoft help IT person at first, but no she meant did I have an IT person somewhere in the home. I then patiently explained that I was the person who set up my PCs and Home network and that It all worked just fine on the other machines. She basically said I am out of luck then.  What?!?!  SO I stated I would need to get a refund. That of course prompted her to say she would transfer me over to the commercial side, could I please hold while she transferred me. Now we're getting somewhere! Nope!  I talked with the commercial side operator, explain yet again the issue and she asks for my domain email account. I do not have one. She says they cannot help a home user. She gives me another phone number. I call it and give them my case number again and explain the issue again only to find out I am back at the basic help desk again. But the help desk person says the even though this is an issue found in Office, it is likely a Windows function causing the problem. He sends me on to the Windows tech support. After waiting on hold for 37 minutes and 17 seconds I finally arrive at a human being, She asks me to please tell her what the issue is. Since I have had plenty of practice by now I can recite it quickly and subconsciously. She states that she would have to escalate the problem so would I please hold, but then we are disconnected and I never receive a call back. I call back to tech support, they say it was unacceptable that I should have to wait so long. I agreed. But they would have to escalate the issue to a higher tier and would it be okay if they called back in 30 minutes to an hour. After verifying they had the correct phone number I thanked him for his time and hung up. And that's the last I heard from Microsoft. Several hours wasted...

So then in about 30 minutes I was able to install Office 2007 on the new machine, check and install all the latest updates,  map the network drives, and verify the proper functioning without even having to set trusted locations - and - bonus - was able to request a refund from Amazon, have it approved, and UPS scheduled to pick up this defective product and send it back.

Kudos to Amazon for being professional to work with and quick to respond. I am so relieved I bought through Amazon instead of Microsoft.

In (1), the recorded audio quality is terrible. This is not the same as the crisp audio quality I experienced back in Office 2013. And sadly, there is no solution to this problem unless you record your voice with a third party software and later sync the audio with the video.
In (2), the laser pointer is disabled despite tons of people requesting for this feature online. It's just not there, unless you record your video and later insert a pointer using some video editing software.

I've been reading some of the 1 star reviews. Here's a tip to keep you out of trouble with bogus products.

If you buy from any other supplier, you are taking a chance what you get will be bogus and not usable, and possibly not returnable.

ORIGINAL POST
About the subscription: 5 Stars. You buy the keycard, enter the code in the right spot, and BOOM your Office 365 membership is extended by a year (if you're renewing). Plus, you save about $15 (for the personal version) over what Microsoft charges if you go through them. How do you pass up $15 off???

About Office 365:
First, 1TB of cloud storage for a year is a good value all on its own. Dropbox will set you back $99 for the same thing. Google Drive, $100. There are OneDrive apps for every mobile device, so you can take your files with you. For cloud storage alone, it's a no-brainer. So even if you HATE Microsoft Office, OneDrive is good.
Second, you get the latest version of Office (currently 2016 on PC). Oh, when Microsoft upgrades Office, you get the upgrade too. No extra costs. This isn't just a bunch of web apps you can't use if you're off the grid, either (ie: Google, Apple). You get the full install on your PC or Mac. You also get one tablet and one phone (Android or iOS), and the apps are actually pretty good on those platforms. Oh, you also get the webapps which, IMHO, are better than the Google or Apple counterparts. Same familiar interface as the desktop/laptop applications, which is nice.

If you need more than one license, there is the Home version. It's about $20 off Microsoft's price, and you get five of everything instead of just one.",Softwares,2017-06-23,5,positive,update ive reading star reviews heres tip keep trouble bogus products make absolutely sure text appears price ships sold amazoncom supplier taking chance get bogus not usable possibly not returnable original post subscription stars keycard enter code right spot boom office membership extended year youre renewing plus save personal version microsoft charges go pass office first 1tb cloud storage year good value dropbox back thing google drive onedrive apps every mobile device take files cloud storage alone nobrainer even hate microsoft office onedrive good second get latest version office currently pc oh microsoft upgrades office get upgrade no extra costs isnt bunch web apps cant youre grid either ie google apple get full install pc mac also get one tablet one phone android ios apps actually pretty good platforms oh also get webapps imho better google apple counterparts familiar interface desktoplaptop applications nice need one license home version microsofts price get five everything instead one,0.2421768707482993,positive,9.0,positive,positive

507,AVV0S45TLSS5W,0763855553,"Further problems with Microsoft 365 Word. Do not try to write macros. Macros in earlier versions of Word work fine. For some reason macros for earlier versions do not work, and if you write a macro that has anything to do with Find/Replace, it will not behave in a similar fashion to earlier versions. This is partly because the people who designed 365 assume users of no particular skill, who are content to use Word just the way it comes out of the box. In other words, Word 365 is more automated, less kindly about those who want to tailor it to do specialized functions. I'm sure that people who are conversant in Visual Basic will have better luck. I am not, and will go back to an earlier version of Word (Everything up to 2010 worked perfectly.)

Again (check below for more), there is little I can discover in Word 365 that warrants a subscription. That you are renting it year by year, from my point of view, is just another Microsoft scam.

I would strongly recommend anyone who has used earlier versions of Office (probably up to 2007 for PC) to stick with the older versions. Although I am still in the free trial period, I find Office 365 Word the most bloated, difficult to use, counterintuitive program of any writing program I have ever used. I think what the designers had in mind was the ultimate ""automated"" program possible--imagine a car with swerve control, automatic parallel parking, object detection, automatic braking. That is what 365 Word is. The ribbon by itself hoards the screen. Though retractable, you will not easily be very productive as you will be spending most of your time searching for the functions that, as far as I know were available in the classic menu in the version previous to 2010. The program is so fully automated that it is human proof. There might be workarounds, but I have as of yet been able to work with its newly designed ""styles"" which they splash across the screen as if, writing were nothing more than prettifying your page. My sense is that the programmers are ""peachy proud"" of all the new features they have built into this mayhem.  You can, of course, after you pay Microsoft for your annual prescription, buy downloadable ""classic menu"" software--that too will cost you, and then, you can buy book, reference books that you can read late into the night.  My question would be why would anyone put money out for a program that is as difficult as learning a new language. And why would a user of  Word all the way back to the '97 version have to dedicated so very much time to relearning what is meant to perform the simple function of writing.
Perhaps you have the time. I'm going back to the 2003 version.

I have since added the classical menu, courtesy of [...] I am still in the 15 day free trial period, but the classical drop-down menu does improve the ease of use of Word 365. The Classical Menu software even has a couple of functions that are not listed in the ribbon menu. I have updated my rating for 365 to two stars. Still a difficult program for us long time users who used to enjoy the transparency of the older versions.

Aug 1. Update. Again, I would warn the user of earlier versions to expect the unexpected. Since I last updated this review, two strange factors  have occurred. First, Word 365 stripped out macros I wrote in my desktop (I followed instructions, went to options/trust/and enabled all macros). It worked on my laptop but not my desktop. Second, for reasons unknown to me, suddenly Word 365 started saving my docx in 365 format and not 93-97. More strange, if you go to your folders from 365, it won't show anything but your 365 formats. This is not true if you go to your microsoft windows view.
Also, I wish to note, that Word, if like me, you have Windows 7 and only 8 gig ram, 365 programs are as slow as molasses in Vermont in the dead of winter.
Adding to its slowness is a splash page inbetween what used to be the relatively simple operation of saving your file. First you have to go to a file screen, then to save or save as or browse, or, etc. The file splash screen is  more aesthetic than functional and again shows the programmers of 365 to be more interested in ""pretty"" over ""efficient.""
I do not think overpriced 365 will last. Libra Office, which I had thought lacked a decent outline format (like Word) now has one, and even an add-on program, Organum.

I am  probably trying the patience of anyone who wants to take in a simple thumbs up or thumbs down. Another defect I discovered in Office Word 365 is that there is no option to create a backup copy of your documents with a ""save."" You can use Options, Advanced to save a backup copy, but it saves your file in the ""Roaming"" folder (if your hard drive goes, your backup goes). Of course, you can use the Cloud, but that too is a separate operation. As with the Classic Menus, you have to buy a special software program if you want to streamline your save procedure.

I cannot remember what it exactly was, so I called the installation support number on the back of the card. An (Indian) technician, very friendly, set up a program to access my computer. After he had worked for some time trying to install Office 365 he informed me that I had some malware (Zeus) on my computer which was the reason that Office 365 could not be installed. He told me that someone else in his company could fix the problem, he would transfer me. The next technician (American?) said he could fix it but this would cost money which I had expected. He offered me a yearly service contract for $150.00 plus $20.00 tax. He tried to talk me into a multi year contract which I refused. When I attempted to pay with my credit card the charge was refused by the bank. The same result with my second credit card. The technician told me I should call my bank ""but not tell them it was for a computer company"". The charge finally was accepted and he started  working on my computer which I could follow, though not understand, on my monitor. After about three hours of activity the first  technician called and told me that everything worked now and Office 365 was installed. So far so good.
Next day I got the invoice from SINGH TECH for $170.00. A few hours later I received an e-mail with a fraud alert from my second credit card that they had denied a suspicious charge of $170.00
I have not received from SINGH TECH any information what was done to remove the virus nor do I know what the service contract entails. I have only received a customer code and a telephone number from the first technician.
My computer, after I upgraded to Win 10, started freezing up occasionally ( about once a day), a nuisance but since it was rare I accepted it. The equipment is some years old, it still works but I cannot get drivers for Win 10 anymore. Now, after the installation of Office 365 and the ""removal of malware""  it freezes up several times a day. I have to do a hard shut-down with the power button and  a start to get it going again. The Office 365, at least what I have used so far, seems to be working ok.
I tried to Google SING TECH (in Baltimore as per their e-mail invoice) which was not so easy to find; what I found were a few web sites asking if the company was ""legit or a fraud"", another one complaining about  having been told he had a virus etc.

Very little maintenance is required. I manually check for updates every week, but I love not having to worry about keeping my Office products updated, because it's done automatically. I have Office 365 Home installed on three PC's and have apps installed on my phone and tablet, ensuring I have access to all my Office products and personal documents any time I need it. And, OneDrive makes sure I have all devices synced with up-to-date versions of my personal documents.

Microsoft makes access to my Office documents easy and convenient. And, Amazon has made renewing my yearly subscription more affordable and just as easy too. I simply logged into my Microsoft account online, added my renewal product key, and checked the expiration date for renewal.

I was concerned by the mixed reviews of this product on Amazon, but they were misleading: renewal was super-easy. And with Amazon Prime, I received the product the day I ordered it.

At first, I was a little concerned that I was sent a Product Key for a '1 year subscription for 1 household' 'Spanish and English' 'Office 365 Home Premium'. Before opening the package, I called Microsoft. They confirmed that this was good for the US market and not some product licensed for a different geography.

To renew, I searched for 'Renew Office 365 for Home'. I selected 'Buy another year of Office from a Retail store'. I followed the instructions: I went to the link provided, entered the 25 character code I received. I pressed Next. Surprise! I was done. (The instructions said that I would need to enter the Microsoft account associated with Office 365, but the registration page knew who I was because I was logged into my Microsoft Account on a different window.)

And yes, the subscription was EXTENDED for 1 year, not set to 1 year from the date I went through this procedure. Separately, I read that you can extend for up to five years, if you are so inclined.

I declined the option for auto-renewals, because I paln to follow this same procedure next year when I need to renew.

This allows me to install four instances, and still have a spare.

Only minor complaint, I started with the 30 trail.  I installed three instances to give it a try on Mac and Windows.  Found it worked well, and bought the license key.  When my trial period was up, I entered my 1-year key.  It was accepted, but only a day or two later received an email that I had been charged $9.99 for a one month subscription.  I had to call to get it sorted out, but the support rep was friendly and finally understood the situation.  Once he did, the charge was reversed and the account ""configured"" to coincide with my actual one year subscription.

The only other item, and this is the reason for removing one star:  the Mac and Windows versions are really different; more than expected.

Yes, there there is a support line somewhere in the eastern hemisphere.  The people on the other end of the line are trained in two things:  1.  Hanging up on you (it has happened to me three times, then MS sends me a survey asking about my support experience)  2.  Saying, ""...that type of support is outside our support boundary."" ...new term for me: Support Boundary.  The support you get is technical only.  That is, if you have a problem getting one of the programs to install. If you want help using the program, you will get this response, ""Sir, go on the Web and find www.office.com/training. There you will find some garbage that says ""We are creating more modules every day.""  I would give it one star, but the saving grace is the included OneDrive TB of memory. That's good, and, so far seems to work well.

So what do I want out of this program?  Pretty easy. I want MS Outlook to sync Contacts, Calendar, and Reminders between my phones and computers.  It is impossible to figure out how to do this.  You will find out that unless you have Office 365 for Business, Outlook does not reside in ""the cloud.""

640,A1K7ER05YTY40G,0763855553,"I bought this as a renewal for the occasional use of Office in our family. My kids are both college students so sometimes they need to produce soft copies of papers in a MS file name.

When the key code arrived, I updated it to my account and then handed the card to my son, assuming that this worked like every other multi-computer key coded software on the planet. It doesn't. My account changed to reflect that my subscription expired and my son's sign-up created a new account. I didn't know about this until MS contacted me to let me know that my service had expired. I followed their instructions and the date simply did not update - no explanation of why or what happened. No error message. The process simply didn't result in an updated expiration date.

So after sorting through MS web pages for 20 minutes to actually get service I could contact, I chatted with online help, who seemed confused themselves, didn't answer my questions and who ended the chat without helping 10 minutes later. How do they expect a customer not to be frustrated by the time they even find access to online chat? Just because they don't know the answers themselves, they could check with someone else rather than ending the chat.

There are other similar office suites available that are both cheaper and similar in functionality. Some even allow files to be saved as MS file types. I bought this product because I'd used it professionally for years. I had no idea the product and especially service degraded to this level. After this experience I don't think I'll ever buy Office again. It's too bad Amazon won't allow this to be returned at this point.

So I now understand that you can only have one online account despite the up to 10 machines it promises to cover.

I was told that you had to use Auto Renew rather that use this package because to MS the product was different than the Office 365 Home Subscription they sell at the MS Store (They couldn't explain how). When I asked what I should do I was told to either start a second subscription under a different email address or wait for the original subscription to expire and start again. Of course, letting the original subscription expire could also mean losing all of our data.

This was confirmed by a supervisor in their support group.
So, the ""renewal"" on the Microsoft Office 365 Home Subscription box only renews a subscription that you purchased from a retail store (not the Microsoft Store).

The product itself is the usual MS Office, not a lot has changed over the years. A few tweaks, they still don't do collaborative editing very well unless you utilize their cloud versions which are far less feature-rich.

679,A1MRPX3RM48T2I,0763855553,"The bottom line:  I like this deal much better than trying to buy an Office 365 license outright from Microsoft because it's cheaper, you get more, and you have a lot more options.

The full review:
More to the point though, Office has become a different animal than it was.  In the long run, Office 365 is a better deal than buying a downloadable, installable product--because you *get* a downloadable, installable product with this deal.

So what exactly are you getting here?

This package is the ability to use the latest version of Office in the browser--meaning, if you're on a machine that doesn't have Office installed, you can log into your Microsoft account (required) and use browser-based versions of all the Office apps.  This also means that the online storage place called ""OneDrive"" (formerly known as ""SkyDrive"") can be used to store up to one TeraByte (1,000GB) of stuff, anything you like, private or public or just shared out as you wish.

It's ALSO the ability to download and install Office 2013 OR Office 2016, on up to 5 machines, for up to 4 people!  That's the cool part.  In the past, you might have to buy more than one copy of Office, or be the sole user, or only put it on a desktop and a laptop.  Now I can put this on my desktop, laptop, and Surface Pro, then install it on my wife's PC and my daughter can also have a copy installed to use.  I've been running Office 2016 for the most part and have been pretty happy with the way it works.  2016 is not hugely different from 2013 or 2010, just in little ways.

This package lets you use Office for a year.  You can buy two or three and stack them to prolong your subscription (if you're afraid the price of Office will go up) or you can extend your subscription to more people (in case you have a bunch of kids and want to add mom and dad and grandma into the number of users).  I added a year using this code.  It was only easy to do because I looked online first for HOW to do it.

Which brings us to the only real drawback to Office 365:  anything to do with the browser.  The browser-based apps try to be as much like the desktop as possible, but they're still not quite the same.  OneNote is probably the closest match I've seen, while Outlook is the ugliest and least useful.  The fact that the browser-based versions run in Azure (""the Cloud"", a.k.a., ""on the Internet"") means that they typically run a bit slower, depending on your Internet connection.  OneDrive is more annoying to manage using the browser, so I find myself using a computer to do most of the work like uploading files/folders, creating new folders, etc.  I use the browser-based OneDrive interface to download individual stuff or share stuff out to people.  The entire browser interface is trying to do the ""Kanban"" look that you also see in Windows 8's ""Metro-now-called-Modern"" apps and parts of Windows 10's look and feel.

My rule of thumb is that the browser-based Office is for small tasks on the go, but for anything substantial I go with the PC.

You also have to use the Office website to mange things like who you share Office with, or how you download.  They make it annoyingly over-complicated to download the 64-bit version of Office if you don't want to use the 32-bit.  You have to choose ""Install-->Language and Install Options-->Additional Install Options--> then pick the specific 64-bit version you want.  There's no good reason to bury the better-performing version that far down except that they hope it prevents tech support complications.

The Home Subscription is: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and a 1TB bump-up to OneDrive, up to 4 people across 5 machines.
The Personal Subscription is the same, but only for one individual user, on up to 5 machines.
The Business version has a lot of other options *and* things to consider when choosing.

Overall, I find this a much better deal than shelling out a few hundred dollars up front and knowing the next version will require me to buy it again, and I don't get the benefit of the added OneDrive storage space.  With this price, it's cheaper and I will always have the option of downloading the latest version of Office or sticking with the one I have.  The browser-based versions I consider an afterthought, or ""bonus feature"" - I wouldn't rely solely on those for everyday work.

I'm a huge fan of the 5 user concept in which you can share this between 5 total users in your household with each person getting their own 1TB OneDrive account and access to Office 365 on multiple devices.  My issue with Office 365 is that the office suite portion is buggy as all hell. After installing on 2 desktops and 3 different laptops Word, Excel, and PowerPoint would all stop responding for no apparent reason on a very regular basis.  So regular that doing any work within Office was impossible. These issues could not be satisfactorily resolved through patching/updates or reinstallation of the Office suite or even starting from a clean install of Windows.  Thankfully, I still had office to my Office 2010 media and after completely removing Office 365 I was able to get each computer back to a stable Office platform.  Hopefully this issue, whatever it is, will be addressed in the upcoming update to 365.

However, when I'm trying to activate my Office installed on Windows, it says I've already reached install limit. It asks me to go to my account to deactivate an install, but the webpage doesn't list any install so there's nothing to deactivate. Now I have 7 months subscription left but unable to use the software.

Microsoft promotes people asking community. I did and not unexpectedly it helped nothing. Then I finally figured out a way to chat with a support guy. He collected whole bunch of my information and told me there's an outage at Microsoft server and asked me to wait 24 hours. Now 2 days have passed and issue still not resolved. Today I reached the chat support again, and Francis Philip (display name Francis M) asked me to wait 24-48 hours again. No apologize and no compensation. I told him I'd already asked to wait. He then said, I could contact someone else in India if I wish, because that's Office 365 guy. I thought I already selected the Office 365 category and now I was asked to dial an India number for solving my issue that caused by Microsoft. I told him I'm on a paid time subscription and now unable to use the software I've paid for for several days. He then said I could cancel my subscription and create a new one if I wish. I told him I'm going to cancel but never renew again. He then sent me a number for billing straightly, with no more explanation. So basically he was not willing to help me anything and kept giving me numbers to dial.

So basically Microsoft is switching to a business model that keeps charging users monthly but not a one-time cost, then when there's an issue at their side preventing user activating, they'll just keep user waiting, neither providing a workaround to at least allow user use the software for now, nor trying to solve the issue right now, not to mention compensation.

I knocked off a star because of the stupid installation I had to go through:

Enough on that - here is where you will have problems installing this product:
If you were a student at a University/College that gave you a free copy of Office 365 (or Office 2013) Pro edition:
The Pro Edition is a limited use product.  It is tied to your student email account - or in my case it was tied to my personal account and school account (double badness for me).  When you graduate, finish, take a break, etc - your school IT department will cut you off from the use of Office Pro.

You must use either the new web browser with Windows 10 (Edge) or Internet Explorer when you are logging into your Microsoft account and then attempting to establish a new or revised account when replacing your old school authored version of Office 365.  Tor Browser and Firefox will not work correctly.

Tried to establish a new account with the new key - did not work
Tried to remove the school version of Office - did not work
Tried to re-associate my email with a new Office account - did not work

You cannot just change the email associated with your former school account and the Home version.  In my case I had to call up Office.com support and have them remove my personal email account from its association with Office Pro (school account) and then enter my new product key, associate my personal email account with the product key, then force the install of Office 365 Home.  After the install, Office 365 (2013)  Pro (school account software) was removed and a Microsoft tool called 'Fix It Solutions' - which essentially removed all the registry entries and hidden files related to the school account.

If you look under your File + Office Account then your User Account - then Manage Account - you will be taken to a page where you will either login to a Microsoft account or you will be forced to login with your student ID/student email account.  Even with a new product key - and the intention of creating a new account - the Pro (school) software prevented me from downloading and installing a new copy of Office Home - due to registry restrictions and a pushed download associated with the Pro (school) version.  Not sure why my school did this - or if it was unintended or just a stupid IT department requirement.

The statement that you can ""install on 5 PC/MACs"", is somewhat misleading.  Here's what I have experienced:
I have 2 Macs (a MacPro and a Macbook) which I share with my wife; we both have our individual logins on both of these machines.  I did a single install on each of them, and then each of us logged into the Office apps to activate them.  When I go to the account page, it shows me that 4 installs have been used, not 2 as I would have expected from the licensing description.  So even though I have 2 installs, on 2 machines, used by the same 2 users, I have used 4 installs, instead of the expected 2.

I contacted support via the My Account page, and they've told me that's the way this is supposed to work.  Although somewhat disappointed, I am happy because it does what I need it to do.

Being able to change and update files on even my iPhone and have them work perfectly when we get back to one of my computers has allowed us to quit lugging around our laptops. When we would use some of the Apple applications such as Keynote and Pages, we could not depend on the changes in the final files and always had to re-edit them. No more thankfully! Also, once you get used to the new interface it is great.

871,A3B2NVTP78WHUE,0763855553,"An incredible product.  Is it worthwhile to get a subscription?  That depends on how up to date you like being and how many machines you have.  The incredible value with Office 365 now is the unlimited cloud storage in OneDrive that comes with it and can be given to up to five unique users.  That alone is worth $100 a year.  You can keep every photo, video, music file, etc on OneDrive and access it on any phone, tablet, or computer with an internet connection.

Yet you also get Office Professional on up to 10 machines (5 PCs/Macs, 5 tablets).  This also means you do not get left behind when a new version of Office hits or when new apps are added to Office.  For instance, Office 2016 is likely to have at least two more new applications in it that may change how productivity is done.  Microsoft Sway is an incredible, intuitive presentation program that is a new take on what Powerpoint does, adding more in some ways while being able to create a multimedia presentation in a simple way.  If you just purchase the current version of Office, you get left out and have to spend more money next year as more and more people begin using the new products.  Office 365 protects you against that.  It also allows for easy activation and deactivation of devices, making Office more portable than ever.

One last feature is the stackability of the subscription.  There are times that you may find Office 365 on sale here or elsewhere.  Maybe an Office 365 card is marked down to $80.  You can buy one or more, add them to your account, and stack years of subscriptions.  Or you can go buy a cheap tablet, get an Office Personal subscription, upgrade it for $20 to Home Premium, and add it to your current subscription.  This means years of Office Professional and years of unlimited OneDrive storage.

This is a great deal at this point with Skype minutes, unlimited cloud storage on the most cross platform cloud service, OneDrive, and Office Professional with all new versions included.",Softwares,2015-02-21,5,positive,incredible worthwhile get subscription depends date many machines incredible value office unlimited cloud storage onedrive comes given five unique users alone worth year keep every photo video music file etc onedrive access phone tablet computer internet connection yet also get office professional machines pcsmacs tablets also means not get left behind new version office hits new apps added office instance office likely least two new applications may change productivity done microsoft sway incredible intuitive presentation program new take powerpoint adding ways able create multimedia presentation simple way purchase current version office get left spend money next year people begin using new products office protects also allows easy activation deactivation devices making office portable ever one last feature stackability subscription times may find office sale elsewhere maybe office card marked one add account stack years subscriptions go cheap tablet get office personal subscription upgrade home premium add current subscription means years office professional years unlimited onedrive storage great deal point skype minutes unlimited cloud storage cross platform cloud service onedrive office professional new versions included,0.2129247015610652,positive,5.0,positive,positive

881,A1I3EGXHBQP654,0763855553,"There was a lot of reluctance amongst old time MS Office users at the idea of 'renting' Office for an annual fee to Microsoft. It felt like MS was trying to shore up into income stream by turning us into subscribers rather than traditional consumers (because they were and are). But if you consider this

365 comes with ALL the office products
365 gives you the very latest version of the office products at all times
365 gives you FIVE separate licenses for 5 computers or devices
365 gives each of your FIVE licensees 1 TB or OneDrive Storage
OneDrive Storage is fully integrated into Windows 8 & Windows 10. It also works on iOS...

These features are neat in and of themselves. I'd also argue it makes 365 a bit of a bargain. Some might argue that owning Office would be cheaper over the long term but I'd have to disagree. 5 licenses covering Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook etc. run about $1000 or so. And eventually you will want to upgrade - some people say you don't have to but as someone who has used Word and Excel since version 1.0...I'd say most full-point version upgrades ARE worth it if you can afford it. And with 365...you've got it.

You can get a personal edition with 1 license for less.

Home editions can be found on sale for around $70 a year sometimes. You can buy 4 of them and take care of ALL MS Office needs and your cloud storage for $280 for 4 years like I did.

I've had a long and sometimes troubled relationship with MS products dating back to the 80s.

919,A9J4UURM4OSDW,0763855553,"I've been using Office for years, probably since it first arrived.  I bought 365 because (1) it has an iPad version that allows the creation of documents on a mobile device and (2) that capability is supposedly integrated with OneDrive, the MS cloud storage offering.  So you should be able to create a document on an iPad and store it either on the iPad or on OneDrive, where you get a free terrabyte of storage with your subscription.

Alas, while Word and Excel work very well on a keyboard-equipped iPad, there's a big glitch with OneDrive. Large numbers of users (including me) can't connect iPad Word or Excel directly to our OneDrive accounts.  So you can't create a document on the iPad and save it in your OneDrive account in one step.  If all the threads on the MS Office 365 support page are right, this problem has been unsolved for months, and it's a deal-breaker for many people. There's a work-around: Download the iPad OneDrive app from iTunes and open docs stored in the cloud from there.  While that's OK for documents already created and saved in OneDrive, it's no help for docs you create on your iPad.  You can save them there, but if you want to use the cross-platform capability you paid for and store them in OneDrive, as far as I can tell you have to email them to yourself, open the email on a computer and save the document in the cloud.  That's a stupid workaround, and if anyone who can tell me how to fix this, please adda comment to this review!  And it's very strange, because it's easy to connect to your Dropbox account from the iPad and access your documents, and it's easy to connect to OneDrive from an iPhone!

Apart from the sad problem with Office apps on an iPad not connecting directly to OneDRive, Office 365 works well and the apps for iPad work surprisingly well.  If you want to use Office on a mobile device, subscribe for a month to try it out and see whether the missing link to OneDrive is too much of a pain to bear.

Having said all that, it's only fair to say that the installation process on a computer was surprisingly easy despite the large number of one-star reviews.  When you install Office 365, it doesn't remove previous versions of Office applications (Word 2010, etc.) but it DOES keep all of your settings, including plug-ins for programs such as Dragon Naturally SPeaking.  That was a surprise and a great relief.

The opening screen for Word and the other applications differs earlier versions of Office.  Instead of a blank spreadsheet or document, there's a screen offering to open create a new document. If you click on Open and then Browse you get to the usual Windows Explorer list of folders and files.  There may be an extra mouse click involved, but from reading some of the unfavorable reviews, I think people were thrown by the changed interface.  It's really OK -- it's just different and you have to get used to it.

So... all in all, I'm still very unhappy by the inability thus far to figure out how to connect Word on my iPad to One Drive without a lot of stupid work-arounds, but the new version does integrate OneDrive so that you can access it from multiple computers.  That puts all of your stuff up in the cloud where it's not going to be destroyed by a hard drive crash.

Background: I had a Microsoft Office 365 Home Premium trial version installed on my computers, and towards the end of the trial period I needed to decide whether or not to buy it from Microsoft or somewhere else. To purchase the annual subscription from Microsoft, it costs $99.99 for one year or $9.99 per month.  Instead, found the key card on Amazon for $69.99 (for the mailing option, mind you the instant download option is still $99.99).  If you can wait for 6-7 days, just order the PC/Mac Key card.

Since I was purchasing the license from Amazon, to avoid getting billed by Microsoft in the meantime, I deactivated my license from my account on the Microsoft website. After the key card was delivered, all I had to do was login to my Microsoft account and update the subscription key. It accepted it without any issues whatsoever. Also, when I tried to open up MS Word, it asked me for the subscription key and to activate the license which I did. This process works for renewal as well.

941,AEUUAYQGWINQ,0763855553,"If you are thinking about purchasing Office 365 so that you can turn your iPad into a serviceable work station, think again. The apps for iPad simply DO NOT WORK.

About one month after purchasing a year's subscription to Office 365, the ""share"" feature stopped working. This means I can't email or provide links to any of the documents I create on my iPad-- which pretty much makes the whole app worthless. Normally, I would have simply contacted a tech support representative and had the problem resolved that next day. That's what I've done with Apple and Amazon. Even smaller online companies I've done business with have a quick and easy chat service that allows them to solve problems quickly. A company's accessibility says as much about its confidence in its product as the performance of the product, itself: if they've got nothing to hide and are truly committed to offering their customers the best possible experience, there's no reason for them NOT to be accessible.

So you can imagine my dismay when I discovered that microsoft tech support is totally and completely inaccessible. After searching the app's ""help"" feature with absolutely no success, after languishing on hold to chat with an online representative that wound up being outsourced and clueless, after digging through the FAQs, forums, and articles to no avail, I came to the sorry conclusion that I could not contact microsoft because it did not want to be found. This is a perfect example of a company that knew it was hawking garbage and, after having flung its refuse in my face, slipped gleefully into the shroud of the inter-web-- never to be seen or heard from again.

In short: Office 365 for iPad is a scam.

I tried to delete and reload the apps with no success. I tried to work directly in word online with no success. I tried saving the documents to the onedrive and directly to the iPad with no success. Copy and pasting what I've written into the body of an email undoes all of the formatting, and is therefore not a viable option. And before microsoft sends one of its cronies to comment on my review: YES. I have absolutely provided the company with a direct comment/feedback on this situation. I provided it nearly two months ago and have seen absolutely no change since.

So, in utter desperation, I've been downloading all of the updates for the office apps as soon as they become available, hoping that one of them would finally solve the ""share"" problem for iPad. But instead of improving the apps, the update has only made them worse. Today's update completely got rid of the ""word count"" feature-- a very basic feature that I rely on to do my job-- and replaced it with some tool that allows me to see the document as a full page instead of the traditional view (... wth?). Now when I search ""word count,"" the help feature swears it doesn't exist, never existed. And I don't have an extra hour to spend trying to communicate with an outsource technician. So today is exactly the day that I decided to stop being nice and write this review.

What we have in microsoft is a company so bloated and monopolized that it no longer cares about the woefully shoddy quality of its products, a company that has sold out to join the scam artist conglomerate of comcast and at&t. It's as if microsoft has a whole separate ""Ways to Piss Off Our Customers Thinktank"" department. I swear it does, because there's no possible way it could be more annoying, inefficient, and downright incompetent.

I know there was a lot of ranting in this review, but the takeaway should be this: if you're wanting to work on your iPad, look elsewhere.

951,A29BGBRZPMLPZM,0763855553,"Something went terribly wrong at Microsoft in 2011-2012. Predicting that the entire globe would soon be replacing their desktops with touchscreen devices and monitors, Microsoft began designing its software with those users in mind. The best example, of course, is Windows 8, which welded together the traditional desktop experience with a metro UI that was minimally useful to desktop users focused on mouse-and-keyboard productivity. After a deluge of criticism, much of it deserved, Microsoft backtracked and began releasing updates to the OS that reintroduced features and options more suited to the desktop user (like the ability to boot straight to the desktop). Windows 8.1 was a big step in the right direction for those of us who use our computers for work rather than play, and Windows 10 promises to be an even bigger leap.

The problem is, Office 2013 -- which is the Office version that currently comes with the Office 365 subscription -- has the same problem as the initial Windows 8. Regardless of what the spokespeople at Microsoft will say, this office suite was designed with tablet users in mind. On a tablet, the Office 2013 experience is excellent, even elegantly simple and beautiful. Great new features, like synching office settings across multiple devices and greater integration with the OneDrive cloud (a service that I'm a huge fan of), add value. On a desktop, however, it delivers the equivalent of the experience that the metro interface of Windows 8 did. All of its aesthetic design strengths become weaknesses on a 22 inch non-touch monitor. It just seems clunky, out of place, and half baked.

The first thing professional users will notice is that there is an awful lot of white space in Outlook.  Things just seem bigger. And it's no accident: the scaling of the software was designed with high-dpi screens (like tablets) in mind. When using Outlook on a normal desktop monitor, you end up reading emails where the name of the sender is an unnaturally large font size. The calendar is no longer visible in the main inbox display, instead replaced by more white space and the aforementioned large font (again, something that makes sense on a higher-dpi display). In other words, everything seems out of proportion. Let me rephrase that -- everything IS out of proportion.

What is worse is the rendering of the fonts. Although this is a problem that actually occurs on all of MS's native application programs in Windows 8. X, it is particularly annoying with Word. After all, I can easily install a different web browser to bypass Internet Explorer, but MS Word is a different beast entirely. In geek language, what MS did was opt to use grayscale font aliasing in these programs instead of the RGB font rendering of its older API. The result, once more, is a great experience on a tablet. On a desktop? Fonts seem just a tad blurry or hazy. Basically the result is that Office 2013 on a desktop gives you the same font experience you would have had if you had ever deselected the ClearType option on any sort of LCD panel running Windows in the 2000s.

What to say about this piece of software then? Well, I uninstalled Office 2013 and reinstalled my old Office 2010. The problem with 2013 isn't that it does away with the Aeroglass appearance, which I like but am not particularly committed to. My problem is that it does away with it for all the wrong reasons: to create a better experience for tablet users. Yet the people most likely so sit down and work for extended periods of time with MS productivity software - like Office - are likely to be those NOT working on tablets, but instead working on good ol' fashioned mouse-and-keyboard systems.

MS is fixing its mistakes with Windows 8. It's time they start doing the same with Office 2013, which seems to be fossilizing the mistakes that Windows 8 eliminated over a year ago. Until it does, I am sticking with Office 2010.

EDIT: I wanted to update this to account for the fact that I have tried out Office 2016, and it has the exact same font issue that Office 2013 had. So if you subscribe to MS Office 365, and you have a nice desktop monitor, you'll be experiencing the same antedeluvian font rendering effects. Terrible.

That didn't work out as planned.

I signed up for 1 month of Office 365 on 8/23/2014 with an expiration date of 9/23/2014. I applied this key card on 9/6/2014 and it showed an expiration date of 10/5/2015. What the heck?! Shouldn't it extend my subscription until 10/23/2015??? The short answer is NO.

I contacted Microsoft support and had a very long chat with an agent before discovering that the key card I purchased was for a 1 year free TRIAL of Office 365. I had already purchased a 1 month subscription, and then started a TRIAL that would run concurrently with my paid subscription. The TRIAL does not extend a subscription. I reviewed the listing on Amazon and the packaging of the key card and did not find any indication that what I had purchased was a repacked TRIAL of Office 365, but that's what it is.

998,A3NU3M8INR4NPG,0763855553,"I am writing this to warn people about one major issue. The IDEA of having copies of office on multiple computers and saving your files to one drive is terrific. With that, you don't have to remember which computer has which document. If you are working on something large, like a book, you can work on it at whichever computer is available. This is a tremendous potential benefit.

The current execution of that idea can be a nightmare.

I cannot tell you how many times I have had to sort out which version is my current version, and which version was the previous version.

After using this software for hours at a time most days over 5 months, I still find it difficult to know the correct answer when I open a document and face the dreaded question ""Which do you want to keep? Keep server version, or Keep My version"". Apparently one of those didn't get my changes. Just yesterday I saved a document which appeared to both save and upload correctly. Then this morning I was faced with the dreaded question. As both saving locally appeared to work, as well as uploading, shouldn't they both have my changes? I chose ""Keep my version"", since saving locally seemed more likely to have succeeded. Wrong! All my changes were gone. Ironically, they really had been uploaded, as I could find the changes in the previous version on the onedrive website.

Writing something like a book this sort of issue can be dramatically more painful.

****Long Version****
My wife and are are busy professionals with very different schedules. We've come to see time as a valuable commodity and needed to have a calendar experience that could be shared across all of our devices. We were both very familiar with Outlook, so we researched Office 365. Given the cloud functionality, OneDrive with 1TB each, and regular updates to the newest versions, it seemed like the best option for us. I use a PC at home and a ThinkPad for work when I travel. She uses a Macbook Air and an iMac. Little did we know that Microsoft has decided to stop supporting (or at least poorly support) their Mac products.

I received the product key in the mail, started it up, and downloaded everything into my PC first. I set up both of our webapp accounts and shared some calendars. I then started working on her iMac next. This is where I ran into a problem. After a couple hours of trying, I just could not find a way to cloudshare anything between my PC, our webapps, and her Outlook account.

I figured that it was some problem on my end. I'm used to troubleshooting things, so I started working on it. After spending another 3-4 hours on it myself unsuccessfully, I finally decided to contact Microsoft. Know that I fully updated everything and explored the online tech support. First, I was directed by an online chat tech to the phone support line. There, I was told that they NO LONGER have a tech support phone line. That's right, if you buy a Microsoft product for your Apple products, you are a second class citizen. You no long have access to a live person!

As for what Mac tech support was available, she first directed me to a site that no longer worked. When I explained this, she carefully spelled it out again (as if I couldn't figure it out), then seemed surprised it still didn't work. She had to troubleshoot this, before finally finding the NEW Mac support site.

The new site mostly contained things I had already found. Microsoft basically continued to lead me to believe that there was some way to make all of this work between a Mac and a PC.  Eventually, I had to go to the community forums. After about an hour of searching there, I discovered that there is no way to do what the product says it does. Office 365 CANNOT share with iMacs or Macbooks. You get an older, outdated product that somehow is advertised as ""new."" Basically, its Office 2011 for Mac, which we already purchased for her three years ago! The WHOLE REASON we bought Office 365 to begin with was to have products that could work together among my Windows PC and Thinkpad and her iMac and Macbook

This borders on false advertising. Its appalling that there is no explanation of this anywhere, not even on the Microsoft website. They do not tell their support team this and I doubt their sales team knows either.  After some searching, I did find out that we could spend additional money ($4 a month) to own our own Exchange account to make this work. That is the only way. I'm debating just biting the bullet, but it would make me more angry to let them extort more money out of money to use an inferior product that I already paid for previously.

****SUMMARY****
Macs get an inferior product from four years ago as a part of Office 365 that has no cloud functionality. If you want to do what Office 365 says it does, with Macs AND PCs, you need to pay more money ($4 a month) to rent your own exchange server for each person with a Mac account. Thus, this will cost you at least $196 a year, rather than the $100 Office365 advertises.

While they did an excellent job nailing the interface on iOS, there are a lot of features that are missing. Drawing tables in Word, for instance, is nowhere near as robust as what's found on the desktop. So designing something like a wireframe or a newsletter is very difficult, if not impossible.

2007 was a good reliable system, but started having an issue where my Outlook Calendar stopped maintaining appointment notifications.

After failing to fix the 2007 issue I bought a $68 a year subscription at Amazon which seems about the right price point for the typical home user.  Hopefully as time passes this price point will be available.

Have only had the 365 installed a few days.  That being said here is my take:

1.  Have four computers I installed on, three Windows 8.1 and one Windows 7.  All installations went exceedingly smoothly with 2007 installed.  Picked up my settings especially email settings with out having to dink under the hood.

2.  Only one issue during the installation, one of my Windows 8.1 computers had an issue where (I believe) Microsoft uploaded an older version of 365 to my machine and I had to get a tech to fix the issue.  About 30 minutes to fix from start of call to resolution.

3.  System is certainly faster (a lot) than 2007 and easy enough to transition over to the new version.

1090,A2W0F8EQ97Z432,0763855553,"I'll defer the whole ""Office"" review to the multitudes of others and focus on the subscription licensing model, which is the core of the O365 vs Office retail difference.  With the regular retail package you pay once and apply the license to one device (and if you're like me have a lot of difficulty switching that license to another PC if you ever replace the original.  With this version of O365 you pay PER YEAR, but always have the latest version, have online storage, and (key for me) INSTALLATION ON UP TO 5 DEVICES.  There is also a ""Personal"" version of O365 for $65 that installs on 1 device - this to me is a waste; if you're only putting on 1 device you'll probably be better suited for the regular Office package.

At $73 I found the Office 365 Home Premium 1yr Subscription Key Card to be an excellent value because of our situation and the 5-PC allowance.  I have my own laptop, and each of my 2 kids have 2 laptops - one that stays at my house and another that stays at at their mother's.  In the past this meant buying 5 different licenses, and go through the pain of trying to swap activations from one pc to another if we replaced their computers every 3 years.  It was possible, but also a pain to set them up and change their behavior to use online document storage so that they could access files whether there or here.  (as a side note to offset those ""why don't you just have them carry their laptops back and forth?"" - one word ""breakage"").

Anyway, it's pretty easy to get set up so that our 5 PCs are all up to date with current versions with the software that they need for their schoolwork, and the online storage is seamless and well integrated so they can always access their files whether they are at their mother's house or mine.

The subscription model worked well for us.  A Basic Office package per PC is $110 - if you are like our situation and have a houseful of devices that's $550, and then expect to pay that again when the newer version comes out or you replaced a PC and had problems getting the licenses migrated to another PC.  Add in the online cloud storage access ease and it definitely improves the cost/convenience model.  Works on PC/Mac and iPads.  I was recently doing extensive business traveling and moved one of my licenses from my laptop to my iPad temporarily while I was more mobile yet still wanted basic edit access to Office package.  When I was back and things settled down I was able to easily switch back again.  Which is of note - if you want to use the Office package for more than viewing and actually need to create/edit Office docs on your iPad you are going to need an O365 license.

I was able to save quite a bit of money over buying the subscription through the App Store or directly through Microsoft by buying this subscription key card.

The apps run beautifully on my two windows pcs and my ipads. By keeping all of my documents in sync across devices by saving them on Microsoft OneDrive (20GB included for free), I have seen a great increase in my productivity. I was in the process of migrating all of my productivity work to Google Drive, but am very disappointed in the way that Google Drive runs on iOS. I was hesitant to embrace the subscription model especially when Google gives it away for free, but now I am a full believer thinking it is well worth it to keep my software up-to-date and running well across all computers without having to worry about upgrading every few years...or locking myself into Microsoft long-term if somebody else comes up with something better. The subscription model will force Microsoft to stay ahead of the curve constantly trying to win its own customers to renew and not being able to rest on its laurels.

This is an excellent way to get a bargain subscription.  The Key Card was only $63.15 for a 12 month subscription, while the direct download was $99.99.  Want to save even more and get instant gratification?  Buy the Key Card on Amazon and it will be delivered in a few days.  In the mean time, sign up for the 1 month free trial at Microsoft:
[...]
You will be able to use Office 365 immediately.  When the Key Card comes in the mail, log into your Office account and apply the product code from the Key Card.  It will extend your subscription 12 months past the free trial month expiration (instead of the current date).  This gives you 13 months for the bargain Key Card price and immediate use of Office 365!

We have 5 computers and 2 smartphones in my house, so this subscription based version of Microsoft Office is much more affordable than upgrading 4 different computers every few years at several hundred dollars per machine.

As for the Office 365 software itself, I don't have enough experience with it yet to truly give it a rating.  I will say installation was painless on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.  OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is your personal syncing cloud that ties to Office 365 (you get an extra 20GB for free with Office 365).

Next you find out only students can use the university edition and they basically need transcripts from a school.  You think, oh, I will use my son to activate/download office but then I don't have three days for the school to verify my son's enrollment.  Then you call Microsoft and they have no idea what a product key card is and can't understand why I haven't downloaded the program yet.  So you figure that you will download it and return the university edition later, checkout page crash-blank, crash, crash but at least there is a chat link on the page(not doing it).
To Walmart and exchange for office 365, expensive but I get 5 devices to use it so it seems like an OK deal.
I get home FINALLY get office on one computer and then I think I have beaten the Microsoft monster.  Then I get to my wife's computer to log in at office online and I am greeted with: This subscription has been cancelled.  Set up an auto-renew subscription.
Maybe I will contact support.  Most likely I will return the card and try again...
On the brighter side the office 365 download order page was loaded after I got home from Walmart with office 365.  I would like to take this time to apologize to a couple of support people I ripped into, rather into Microsoft on the phone.  Microsoft should realize that the world doesn't revolve around them for people that do not work in an office(ex. send all files in word 97-2003)and they cannot keep customers loyal with this experience.  This begs the question why has no one tried to take on the Microsoft behemoth with a competing, and dare I say(I said it), office suite.  So needless to say I had to pass on my work to another person and my manager wasn't pleased.  I especially likes the enter product key-login-enter product key again bit.  Priceless.  They have the fools lining up.

Everyone agrees on the REAL expiration date, no one will take ownership to really resolve the problem.  I asked for a one month extension on my subscription for the aggravation, time, and cost that I have gone through.  Of course Microsoft states they can't do that because I bought it from Amazon.  I asked Microsoft if I purchased Amazon Office or Microsoft Office.  One manager came up with the bright idea to sign up for a free 30 day trial and that would be the month????

1155,A1ZXSQHOVC0TCX,0763855553,"We bought two new PC's for our high school aged kids this Christmas (2013).  Obviously, they were each going to need a copy of Office for their schoolwork.  We wanted to upgrade our home laptop too.  Since this allows you to install on up to five PC's the pricing worked out better for us in the short term.  We didn't have to shell out $600 for three copies of Office 2013.

Gone, are the days of owning and installing a copy of Office on your laptop.  Typically, you'd replace a PC every five years, or so, anyway.  Most people would always install a new copy of Office on a new laptop, so you'd be purchasing a new copy for each machine at $200 every few years.  This ends up costing about the same or less if you are installing on multiple machines.  For installation on one machine, you might be still be better off to purchase a copy.

Installation was easy.  We installed it on the old laptop as well as the two new ones with no problems.

Again, the biggest advantage is that (for $99/year) you can install on up to five machines.  If you get rid of a PC, you can simply go to your Microsoft account and deactivate that copy.  That frees up a copy that you can download to a new PC.  Another advantage is that it remains updated too.  No more wondering if you want to spend the money to upgrade to the latest version - you'll already have it!

This version also comes with all of the Office products too.  We don't use them all, but they're available if we ever need them.

(2)  I had to download a cumbersome program in order for the service to interact with Office on my PC and Mac. (3) Worst of all, the Office 365 word processor doesn't work with iPad, which makes it unusable for me.

Big surprise, this Microsoft product is Windows-centric.

In the end I bought Pages. It's the best iPad word processor I've used, and all my documents show up on iCloud. From there I can download them as Word documents or copy and paste whatever I need into a blank Word document.

For someone who works entirely with Windows and needs to access files in different locations or while traveling, the Office 365 subscription could be a useful tool.

1182,AHNHLGKIZ2N3B,0763855553,"The current trend for software companies is to provide ""software as a service"" (SaaS) where the user licenses an application for a finite amount of time.  There are pros and cons for the user here - since it's basically cloud-delivered, you don't need to worry about holding physical discs or keys; you can more easily use it on multiple devices (including Microsoft tablets - sorry iOS/Android users); you don't pay for it longer than you need it.  This model could work well for apps with specific uses that would otherwise be overly expensive, e.g. Photoshop (Adobe also rolled this SaaS plan out earlier this year to much anguish).  However, for the basic word processing, spreadsheet and presentation uses that most people look to Office for, this model could actually turn out to be more expensive in the long run.  Put another way, most people are likely using a version of Office that is many years old and that's still fine for their simple uses - that Word 2007 (or even 97!) that you purchased for perpetuity still lets you type, format and print those handful of letters that you need to create each year.  So I believe that only power users of Word, Excel and/orPowerPoint and/or homes with multiple PCs would really benefit from the SaaS pricing model.  Others will likely be frustrated when forced to fork over another $99 (unless the cost goes up, which there are no guarantees that it won't) every 12 months.  Microsoft packages some online goodies to soften this blow - Skype minutes and 20GB of online storage - but many either won't use this or will know that there are cheaper/free ways to get the same elsewhere.

Installation was as straightforward as any Microsoft install.  You will need to tie it to a Microsoft online account for the cloud storage purposes.

In use, I find that each subsequent version of Office gets worse in its user experience design.  I was a wiz with Office 2003, zipping through keyboard shortcuts and quickly formatting great-looking documents and presentations.  Since the new ribbon-based navigation interface in 2010, I feel that Office apps are hiding most of their functions and how to navigate through the menus/options.  Simply put, I don't feel that these newer versions of Office enable me to be as productive or creative as I had been with past versions.  I know that I'm not alone in this view, but unfortunately it seems that Microsoft is more focused on their SaaS profit model and shoehorning in touch screen gimmicks (as if everyone will then run out and buy a touch-screen PC, upgrade to Windows 8, and/or grab a Surface tablet).",Softwares,2013-10-17,3,positive,current trend software companies provide software service saas user licenses application finite amount time pros cons user since basically clouddelivered dont need worry holding physical discs keys easily multiple devices including microsoft tablets sorry iosandroid users dont pay longer need model could work well apps specific uses would otherwise overly expensive eg photoshop adobe also rolled saas plan earlier year much anguish however basic word processing spreadsheet presentation uses people look office model could actually turn expensive long run put another way people likely using version office many years old thats still fine simple uses word even purchased perpetuity still lets type format print handful letters need create year believe power users word excel andorpowerpoint andor homes multiple pcs would really benefit saas pricing model others likely frustrated forced fork another unless cost goes no guarantees wont every months microsoft packages online goodies soften blow skype minutes 20gb online storage but many either wont know cheaperfree ways get elsewhere installation straightforward microsoft install need tie microsoft online account cloud storage purposes find subsequent version office gets worse user experience design wiz office zipping keyboard shortcuts quickly formatting greatlooking documents presentations since new ribbonbased navigation interface feel office apps hiding functions navigate menusoptions simply put dont feel newer versions office enable productive creative past versions know im not alone view but unfortunately seems microsoft focused saas profit model shoehorning touch screen gimmicks everyone run touchscreen pc upgrade windows andor grab surface tablet,-0.013707386363636364,negative,-8.0,negative,positive

1184,A16QODENBJVUI1,0763855553,"Innovation is a good thing when the point of innovation is to improve one's products and to enhance the experience of ones customers. But innovation as a way of creating a false impression of progress to mask a need to perpetually carve out market share is vile, and it has long driven Microsoft's business plan and service model. But two other marks of Microsoft has been its attempt corner a portion of the market, give the consumer no real alternative, and then force them to pay through the nose, meanwhile making it harder and harder to use previously purchased versions of the product. And to complete my portrait of the Microsoft that I hated to like, Microsoft had an absolutely dreadful customer service department. Not that Customer Service was inept, but merely unavailable. And turning the old department store adage on its head, not only was the customer never right, they were most likely very much wrong.

As a result, Microsoft had over time created a way of doing business that was out of touch with the needs of the customer. Indeed, I had come to dislike Microsoft so much that I stuck with my old copy of Office 2000 for years longer thatn I had any desire to. But I was not going to pay an absurd amount of money for a piece of software that they were only going to allow me to put onto one device, and that was not going to be supported by technical support.

So imagine my shock when I found myself something of a fan of their new way of doing business. Instead of being prohibitively expensive, Office 365 is reasonably priced. You pay less than $80 for a key to unlock a download on up to five devices. Or if $80 is too pricey, you can pay just under ten dollars a month for the same five-device key. And unlike in the past, when you paid a large amount of money for a single-user key to Office Lite (the Student Edition was essentially Word and Excel, while the subscription grants you the use of more Office programs, including Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Publisher, and One Note. What was once a prohibitively expensive suite of programs suddenly became very reasonably priced (no doubt in part because pirated editions meant that instead of paying an absurd amount of money to Microsoft, people would simply go to a Torrent site and get a free copy of Office).

And to make everything even more impressive, Microsoft's customer service is more accessible than ever. I had a particularly difficult installation due to preinstalled trial editions of Office 365 on my new computers. Microsoft worked with me at length to make sure Office 365 installed properly on all of my devices. Not just that, but when I expressed the wish to use my Hotmail e-mail address on Outlook, they escalated the problem to a higher level tech support person.

Now, that doesn't mean that this is a perfect product. I have not liked the direction that Office has taken since Office 2007. And Microsoft still fails to include a crackerjack WYSIWYG HTML editor. But all in all I'm impressed with the nontechnical aspects of Office 365. And I have to admit that it is kind of fun having at least portions of Office installed on my desktop, my lap top, my smart phone, and my tablet. In a family with multiple computer owners, it should be possible for each family member to have a full version of Office installed on their computer.

One positive feature of Office 365 is the SkyDrive which enables you to save your documents and projects to the cloud and access them from other locations. I also like that 365 makes it possibly to easily collaborate on projects by inviting others to access the document. The other person does not have to have the same version of Office that you do, it can pull up the document in a browser and they can view and make changes as needed. You can also work on SkyDrive documents when you're offline and then they'll update when you have an internet connection again (BUT if the document was updated at another location and you don't have internet access, then you won't be accessing the most up-to-date version, which I view as a bit of a liability.) I have been known to save important documents to both my SkyDrive and my computer just as a back-up in case the Internet gods decide to shut up the data heavens.

An added feature of Office 365 is access to Office Mobile Apps. Unfortunately, my smartphone (HTC Desire) is not compatible with the Office Mobile App and so I can't make use of the mobile features. However, the subscription does include the option of adding up to five mobile devices (but I imagine they have to be fairly recent mobile devices or you might run into the problem I had of the device being incompatible with the app). I was kind of bummed that it won't work on my device. It would have been convenient to be able to access my documents on the go, but oh well, what can you do.

Installation is fairly easy. You just go to the website, enter the product key and connect it to your Microsoft account (or you can start an account with any e-mail address). It will let you download the software on up to five computers, BUT as the name Office 365 indicates, you will only have access to the software for 365 days. After that point you will have to pay all over again for another year's access to the software. The positives of that is that you will always have the most up-to-date Office software (automatic updates are included in the subscription), but the obvious con is that you'll be perpetually paying for a subscription. Honestly, my personal preference would be just to own the software outright (I'm OK with not having the latest and greatest version). They do throw in a few extra perks to help lessen the pain of an annual subscription: Skype 60 minutes a month world calling & SkyDrive with 20 GB storage.

It did take a little while for the program to download, but if you have any experience with Office products, it is pretty easy to find your way around. I do like that you have the option of downloading on up to five computers and five mobile devices, but you do have to be prepared to repay for the right to access the software annually.

It wasn't always this way, as those who have been computer users for some years will remember well. In fact, we may have all been running WordPerfect Office with its affiliated programs if it wasn't for some strange twists in computer history beginning in the 1990s.

There are a number of variations of this Microsoft Office suite that can be found here, but this review is specifically focused on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-365-Home-Premium/dp/B009SPTUW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office 365 Home Premium</a>. This version is is a one-year subscription downloaded from 'Net by entering a product key card, and is licensed for up to five users on PCs, Windows 8 tablets, and Macs (with some limitations - see the specs). It offers the current versions of Word, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Access and more.

Please note: I had previously installed the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Office-Home-Business-2013-Key-Card-1PC-1User/dp/B009SPWJ98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Office Home & Business 2013 Key Card 1PC/1User</a>&nbsp;version on a Window 7 PC notebook, and that version had worked quite well. The annual subscription to Office 365 Home Premium became a worthy option for a new PC running Windows 8 as a development/test system for both hardware and software, so when it came to making a decision as to which suite to go with, curiosity won out.

Here are the highly-subjective likes and dislikes found so far with this installation of the new Office 365 Home Premium suite for those looking for just the key points, then followed with some expanded details.

 Likes:

+ Very smooth installation; simple directions, easy to follow, almost effortless
+ Clean interface; smooth and minimalist, ribbon can be collapsed as needed
+ Operates on five PCs or Macs; license for single household with multiple users
+ Excellent Outlook integration; works well with Outlook.com, Gmail and private email
+ SkyDrive; allows for access of files on the cloud, file sharing when needed
+ Easy customization once installed; make it work your way

 Rants & Irritants:

- Full ALL CAPS menu tabs; don't like having the Metro-style jammed down my throat

 Installation:

The setup is simple and easy to follow. Included in the small box are the directions and a 25-character Product Key card. Go to the Microsoft Office site as indicated, enter the characters from the card as noted, then sign into or create your Microsoft account. Users who already have an Outlook account (possibly converted over from Hotmail) can start with that. Then it's a simple scenario of following the on-screen directions, and the entire installation should be finished in under 30 minutes.

Found the interface to be much cleaner than my older Office 2007 running on another older computer, and with the exception of the CAPS ON menu tabs noted above, it was a good improvement. Though I did not do any precise stopwatch timings, Office 365 seemed to load faster and smoother. The ribbon menu can be collapsed or expanded as needed. When you open up Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Publisher, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document, which is just an extra click away.

What follows are some subjective notes about the various components found within this Office 365 Home Premium suite. I won't attempt to go too heavy into each of these as one could write a full review on most of the modules by themselves, but consider these as observations found from a few weeks use.

 SkyDrive:

I like SkyDrive and have been using it for some time. This has been integrated quite well within Office 365 Home Premium, and has built in resilience against jittery Internet connections. Should you should lose your connectivity while working on a file opened from a SkyDrive account, Office 365 saves it temporarily on your local hard drive before synchronizing with SkyDrive at a later point in time. And what is good is that it syncs quite well so that you can retrieve/edit documents (or images) from other computers once you're logged in.

 Word:

The features for Word have remained largely the same as those in Office 2007 and those that I've found working on clients' Office 2010 installations. Documents often need to be edited after they are written, and Word 2013 makes the editing process easier with such new features such as the ability to edit PDF files. Previously, you needed to install third-party software, such as Adobe Acrobat. This was available to those of us who have been running Word for Mac 2011 where it does a respectable job, but is new to the PC version. Have not had much time to play with it, but if it works as well as the Mac version, then this will be a big help.

Among the new additions that I've found are that you can watch embedded videos right there within the document, and without having to go to a different application. If you work with collaborative documents, you can reply within comments and those replies will be displayed in threaded conversation style.

 Excel:

On a personal note, I have had a love/hate relationship with spreadsheet programs in general since the days of Microsoft Multiplan and Lotus 1-2-3, both of which are distant history now. That being said, Excel has been a program of choice for years now, and one that I've used to input table data into Word and as a flat file database for quite some time. Entering data into spreadsheets can be a tedious and boring chore, so the downward fill feature in Excel that allows you automatically fill the cells in each row with the same number by dragging down has been an ally.

But now there's a new Flash Fill feature that recognizes patterns in your data functions, then automatically fills in the rest of the spreadsheet, and complex formulas are not necessary. You can make it automatically format names the same way (such as last, first, middle initial) just by giving it some examples. Phone numbers can be converted to a uniform format, such as (212) 555-1212, and restore the leading zero to zip codes is a breeze. Look for the Flash Fill button on the Data tab and try it. It's well worth it.

 OneNote:

This is probably one of the most overlooked and underrated components of the Office suites. First encountered it in Office 2007, and it became a handy way to keep simple notes and such, but it was limited. The new version will allow you to embed Excel spreadsheets and see the preview within your note. When you update the spreadsheet, the preview automatically updates, as well. Searching within OneNote is better, as you can now search for words that are embedded in graphics files.

 PowerPoint:

There's a new, cleaner look to PowerPoint. You can start a new presentation using a theme, a template, an older presentation or a more recent one, as well as a blank one. New users should find PowerPoint 2013 to be more intuitive than older versions, and those who are experienced PowerPoint pros will find that everything seems to go smoother. I pulled up some old presentations, including one that was from the late 1990s, and found that doing a few edits was a very smooth process. The themes now come with variations, so tightening up on the look you want is simpler.

 Outlook:

There's an openness to this upgraded version. Outlook is a powerful module, but it will take new users a bit of time to learn to navigate among all of the functions and to understand the numerous toolbar icons, as I found out when showing mine to a colleague. I've been using Outlook under Office for Mac 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and never had an issue with Outlook on the OS X platform. I'm currently trying to sync the two versions as much as possible.

 Publisher:

I personally use Publisher infrequently at this point. Like the other modules in Office 365, you'll find a selection of templates on the left side of the screen instead of just a blank document.

 Access:

The Office Access relational database management system was a product that at one time was a favorite when I was converting over from dBase III many years ago. Speaking honestly, I have not accessed this module, and pardon the pun.

 Annoyances & Irritants:

My primary gripe with the new Office suites has to do with the full ALL CAPS menu tabs, and I'm trying my best to see if I can learn to adapt or if I'll change it. As noted earlier, I don't like the ""new"" Microsoft Metro style being jammed down my throat without the option to change it easily. It's essentially the same one that we find on the Office pages on the Web. There is a workaround, but it must be done in each individual Office 2013 module that you use: go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon, then use the Rename button on each one of the main menu items listed in the right pane under Customize the Ribbon. Instead of changing the name, however, add a space to the end of the name, and then click OK. When you return to the Home tab, the ribbon menu items will be displayed in a title case, with only the first letter capitalized. You can also go back to the ALL CAPS default by resetting them.

 Suggestions:

Putting this simply, if you're happy with Office 2007 or 2010, you may want to weigh your choices between the various versions here, read some of the reviews that best apply to your own needs, then decide whether you wish to keep the earlier version or go for the upgrade. My decision to try Office 365 was based on the fact that it was going to be a 'clean' install on a new Windows 8 PC and that I had a year to use it and see if it was worth the subscription, or if it might be better to go with a 'regular' license for another version. My installation went smoothly and it works well; your results may differ from mine.

I have not tried an installation on a Windows 7 PC to date, but have been largely impressed with how well it runs on a standard, out-of-the-box Windows 8 PC. Please note: this review will be dynamic in that as I find experiences worth sharing, be they pro or con, they will be appended to this review. Other findings or additional resources may be listed in the comments.

1194,A14OQ67LM79KW3,0763855553,"Just to let everybody know who reads this review I am not an office expert I have office because I need it a few times a year.

So what I'm going to base my review on Is the ease and convenience of office 365 compared to the way the box software works. it is so much more affordable if you have more than 1 computer or device.

  So I'll start from the very beginning with my experience with office 365.

  You get a rather small box in the mail and when you open it up there's a business sized card in the box. I suggest you immediately take a picture of the key with your cell phone that way if you lose the box or damage the key you still retain the product key.

  You navigate to the website on the card
Put your product key and verifies it immediately then you log into your Microsoft account if you have one if you don't at this time you can easily and quickly make one.
  And then you can download office and you're up and ready to go it's literally that quick.

  What's great about office 365 is you can use it on up to five computers which is really cool. and with being able to save your work on the cloud it's accessible to all of the computers that you have this office  on.

  The downloading of office if I remember correctly was about a gig in size so if you're bandwidth limited this could take a little time.

  Another neat thing is within that five computers they could be Mac or PC --I'm in a all mac household and everything worked without a hitch.

And the best thing about it is the price I usually have to have a current version of office on my computer even though I don't use it every day and this seems like a fairly affordable way to do it especially with Amazon's discounted price.

 you can also install it on up to five smartphones as well --it actually works with the iPhone .I only played with it for a little bit on there, I don't see me using it very often but if you're in a pinch you can have it there.

So overall if you need office this is a good, affordable, easy way to get it on all of the computers in your household.

hope this helps you  !!!",Softwares,2013-09-29,4,positive,let everybody know reads review not office expert office need times year im going base review ease convenience office compared way software works much affordable computer device ill start beginning experience office get rather small mail open theres business sized card suggest immediately take picture key cell phone way lose damage key still retain key navigate website card put key verifies immediately log microsoft account one dont time easily quickly make one download office youre ready go literally quick whats great office five computers really cool able save work cloud accessible computers office downloading office remember correctly gig size youre bandwidth limited could take little time another neat thing within five computers could mac pc im mac household everything worked without hitch best thing price usually current version office computer even though dont every day seems fairly affordable way especially amazons discounted price also install five smartphones well actually works iphone played little bit dont see using often but youre pinch overall need office good affordable easy way get computers household hope helps,0.14550264550264552,positive,19.0,positive,positive
1195,A17A1KTVI3DG6U,0763855553,"We have several computers in my house, and I was looking for an economical option. Considering the fact that I probably go through a primary PC for work about once every two years, the price point of the Key Card was very attractive to me.

As far as the software itself, the tweaks took a little getting used to, as always; but, after using them for a while now, I definitely prefer the new Word and Excel to their predecessors. Of course, there will always be some things that can be done without, like having to select a new page, or blank workbook from among templates every time the program is opened, or the cutesy graphics around the borders of the applications.

Office is still a five star product in my book. Perhaps even more so now that Microsoft is offering different licensing options.",Softwares,2013-09-29,5,positive,several computers house looking economical option considering fact probably go primary pc work every two years price point key card attractive far software tweaks took little getting always but using definitely prefer new word excel predecessors course always things done without select new page blank workbook among templates every time program opened cutesy graphics around borders applications office still five star book perhaps even microsoft offering different licensing options,0.14043560606060604,positive,2.0,positive,positive
1196,AZZ5ASC403N74,0763855553,"Microsoft Office is pretty much the standard software used by most businesses and individuals.  This version contains Word for word processing, Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, OneNote to help keep you and projects organized, and Outlook to manage your email.  This is the version that can be installed on up to five devices and is only valid for a one year subscription.  I'm not a fan of this type of subscription, but the cost is lower than buying the one pc version, and this can be used on windows tablets and phones, as well.  It's just a matter of determining how you will use this software and deciding which version is right for you.  For those who prefer cloud storage, 27GB on MS SkyDrive is included with this subscription.  This means you can log in from any pc and access the documents you have stored there. (like google drive)  Although, I have not used this feature, the documentation states that you receive 60 minutes per month of Skype international calling.  If you are updating from Office 2007 or 2010, you shouldn't have too much of a learning curve.  The change from Office 2003 (if you are still using that version) is pretty drastic, though.  There are many tutorials on the MS website to help you along.  I've used this software for years, and recommend it highly.

1197,A23WE2XLY1MROA,0763855553,"The most important thing to realize when selecting this product is that it is a 1 year license. In other words, you will need to repurchase Office, or at least a new subscription, in a year. There are multiple packages for Microsoft Office 2013, each slightly different, with a different cost. I recommend looking up a chart and comparing each before making a purchase.

Office 365 w/ a 1 year subscription contains a bonanza-
-Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Publisher, and Access
-SkyDrive with 27 gb of storage, free for a year
-Skype with 60 minutes of international calls free per month
-Licenses for 5 computers (either PCs or Macs)

However, there are notable exceptions for macs-
-OneNote, Publisher, and Access are not available for Macs.
-Office 2013 is PC only; Macs receive Office 2011. (The updated mac version is produced the year after the PC version, therefore expect Office 2014 for Macs.)

If you are buying for PCs there are few changes in 2013 from Office 2010, but if you have an earlier version, the update is likely worth it. Similarly, if you are buying for Macs and don't already have Office 2011 it may be worth the purchase, but otherwise wait until next year.

The registration process is clear and easy to complete, registration of further computers is also simple, and adding the subscription to your skype account is as simple as putting in your password.

1198,ATCFWCFJ28WR9,0763855553,"Full disclosure: I was sent this item to review months ago but was afraid to install it because of all the negative reviews here. I finally put it on an 'extra' cheap laptop we have at home, not my own machine. It seems... ok, though I'm not sure what it's trying to be. I have worked in an Office environment in the workplace for I guess 15 years now and am used to having a version of everything that's a bit old (still using Office 2010, for instance). I find except for cosmetic changes, like the introduction of the ribbon interface with Office 2007, that I can usually live without an upgrade more than once every few years. I also am already using what I feel are better cloud-based collaboration tools. It seems like MS was trying with this to be a bit Apple, a bit Google, but not overall much different.

The product installed ok and runs ok, but I feel for those who have had to contact tech support. Been there; it's horrible.

1199,A4U27URFECK1U,0763855553,"I'm not sure why so many people are having problems downloading and installing Microsoft Office 365. As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).

The new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the ""theme"" chosen. Pretty unexciting.

As far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on ""File"" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.

Office 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.

Microsoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating.

1202,A22CT4ZGGD2FJF,0763855553,"Let me start of by saying I've been using MS Office since the days of Windows 95. I honestly cannot keep up with all the names and versions Office has gone through over the years. First, I really do NOT like the subscription based model. I believe I should OWN the software I buy, not RENT it for a year. Also, the new technology of cloud services, etc are really unnecessary for the average home user. But your mileage and requirements may vary. This version of Office is installed on my laptop running Windows 8 and installation was simple and pain free. Now using the Office suite is somewhat different. There is a slight learning curve for the new menu's and features, but don't worry it isn't anything too mind-boggling.

Only Microsoft knows for sure. They seem to have me down as an owner, which, considering that I have a ""not for sale"" marked copy is unusual. A letter to them a few days ago hasn't had a reply yet.

When you get this product there is no CD - just a card with a keycode on it. I did what I thought Microsoft wanted of me - downloaded the demo copy from them, and then entered the keycode. I now have a working copy, but did I just pay for the privilege?

Apart from that, this is the best way to buy Office. You can install this five times on five different computers which means that if you split the costs with four others you end up paying less than $20 a year (though Microsoft won't guarantee the price will be the same next year). You get the use of Office 365 days a year, with any improvements that transpire during that time.

I like Office considerably, and this is basically Office 2013. Because I use Office a lot, I'm used to things that people get upset about. For instance, I feel very positive about the Ribbon which other people don't like. I find it hard to recommend anything else, and as long as Microsoft keep offering this at a low price it's a no-brainer.

1208,A379DLIAF0MFM5,0763855553,"(Note to Mac users: OneNote, Access and Publisher not available.)

I have two computers for work, one is a desktop (iMac) that I use in my home office and the other is a MacBook Pro that I use on the road.

For me the SkyDrive is outstanding because it allows me to quickly and easily share my important Word docs, PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets to the SkyDrive where I can access them from either of my Macs and also from ANY computer via my account at [...] This also ensures that if something happens to one computer (or both), my important files are safe.

I can also access everything from my iPhone with the Office Mobile app. I also have a Kindle Fire, but it isn't supported at this time.

You can see all of your uploaded documents on the  ""My Office"" web page. You can also create new Word, Excel, PowerPoints there, too. Using the ""Web"" version to do so is very similar to Google Docs - only with more features/functionality.

Unlike other cloud-based sharing sites, saving to your SkyDrive is as simple as saving the document. For a Word doc, for example, the path is: File, Share, Save to SkyDrive. From there you have the option of saving it to your documents, which is a private folder, or to Shared/Public folder. (I uploaded a screenshot of this menu at the top of the Amazon product page).

The public folder is ideal for sharing videos and other large files with friends, family, etc. Microsoft hasn't quite perfected the public sharing side, but it is close. Since I'm on a Mac, I have the option of sharing via email, Message (IM), AirDrop or Vimeo. I would like to see one more choice: ""Direct Link,"" which would copy a shortened URL onto your clipboard that you could paste into anything.

I've also installed Office 365 onto my wife's MacBook and her iPhone. It's good to know we have ""room to grow"" should we get another computer or smartphone. Up to 5 computers are supported, and also 5 smartphones.

Installation. All you need is that Product Key despite the boxy packaging (a vestige from another era).

Installation is easy: Enter your product key at [...] You can then install Office onto your Mac (or PC). There is a drop-down menu with a choice between a Mac or a PC. Up to 5 machines

Same page for smartphones The drop-down menu lets you choose either Windows Phone, iPhone or Android phone. You can use Office apps on up to 5 devices. For my iPhone, I was instructed to enter my mobile phone number and it then sent an SMS with a url. I clicked that and a webpage opened then opened the AppStore to download the Office 365 app.

Final note: I advise all Office 365 users to make a copy (or two) of their product key (which comes on a business card-sized card) and store it in a safe place - better safe than sorry.",Softwares,2013-09-20,5,positive,note mac users onenote access publisher not available two computers work one desktop imac home office macbook pro road skydrive outstanding allows quickly easily share important word docs powerpoint presentations excel spreadsheets skydrive access either macs also computer via account also ensures something happens one computer important files safe also access everything iphone office mobile app also kindle fire but isnt supported time see uploaded documents office web page also create new word excel powerpoints using web version similar google docs featuresfunctionality unlike cloudbased sharing sites saving skydrive simple saving document word doc example path file share save skydrive option saving documents private folder sharedpublic folder uploaded screenshot menu top page public folder ideal sharing videos large files friends family etc microsoft hasnt quite perfected public sharing side but close since im mac option sharing via email message im airdrop vimeo would see one choice direct link would copy shortened url onto clipboard could paste anything ive also installed office onto wifes macbook iphone good know room grow get another computer smartphone computers supported also smartphones installation need key despite boxy packaging vestige another era installation easy enter key install office onto mac pc dropdown menu choice mac pc machines page smartphones dropdown menu lets choose either windows phone iphone android phone office apps devices iphone instructed enter mobile phone number sent sms url clicked webpage opened opened appstore download office app final note advise office users make copy two key comes business cardsized card store safe place better safe sorry,0.23143523143523143,positive,27.0,positive,positive

1210,A1GQRGB8FGSLIZ,0763855553,"The software rental business is growing but at least Microsoft still has standalone version unlike Adobe and their CC product.  There are added benefits by purchasing Office 365 Home Premium;however, you are renting so if you decided not to renew you no longer own the rights to having Office 2013.  I had already purchased Office 365 Home Premium prior to the copy I received in the prime program.

The benefit of the subscription is you are allowed to have Office 2013 installed on 5 computers.  It is important to note that you will need to use the Microsoft account you used to register the software to install the software on the 5 computers.  There is no option to send other household members a link to install the software.  You do not need to stay logged once the software is installed.  It is also important to note that you will need Windows 7 or 8 to install Office 2013.

If you are already using Office 2010 I do not see any major improvement to move to Office 365. Office 2013 is very similar to Office 2010 but integrated with the cloud.

Here some of the biggest issues I have with Office 365 Home Premium.  I reached out to Microsoft support to verify my findings. I kept the complete chat log.

All these so called benefits / add-ons are only good for the person who signed up for Office 365 Home Premium.

20GB Skydrive, Skype Account, Office on Demand only apply one account.  There is no option to create a sub-account for household members. Your only option would be to share your account and password information. While I have no issue providing my spouse my information but I will not provide my credentials to my account.  You can sign them up a regular Microsoft account, so that gets a 5GB skydrive, Office Web Apps that integrates with Office 2013

That being said as the primary account holder you do get a good value. Microsoft recently added the Office App for Android and IOS.

I had a skydrive when they offered 25GB, so I now 45GB of cloud storage that I can sync between by laptop and desktop with a Skydrive install.

I rarely used Skype in the past and that will most likely continue even with the included minutes.  I still have not used the Office on Demand, so I cannot provide an opinion

You have to decide if Office 365 Home premium.  If there was more flexibility with household accounts I would rate a minimum of 4 stars.  If you are XP and Vista user you should not purchase this product.

If you work at a company that has an active Microsoft Enterprise Agreement you should check with the EA Administrator because you may have access to the Home Use Program which allows you to purchase Office 2013 for $10

1236,AY3ZV1KAP7I8O,0842340351,"The Life Application Bible from Tyndale House publishers is one of the best Bibles I have read. It has a timeline showing the chronology of Bible events along with important world events. This allows you to understand how the Biblical events fits in the World history.
  Each book of the Bible has a book introduction with Vital statistics that describes the purpose of the book, author, historical setting, key verses, key people and a blueprint which gives a summary of the book.  There is a map in the beginning of each book, showing the key places of events in the book.  Also you will find character studies of different Biblical characters like Moses, David,etc.  All over the Bible there are foot notes throwing more light into the verses. At the end of the Bible,  there is an index to the notes and there are few colour maps. A carefully organized cross-reference runs along the margins of the Bible text.
  I find this Bible easy to read without straining the eyes, with large clear print.  Also the foot notes are not disturbing when you want to skip them and focus on the Biblical text.

I just purchased the Kindle E-book version and it is awesome.

Study notes are easily accessed by selecting the link, then you get back to the verse through another link on the notes page.  Maps are clearly readable on the paperwhite and can be enlarged by pressing and holding on the map, then selecting the magnifying glass that pops up.

Navigating between books is fairly easy on the Kindle Paperwhite and the tablet.  Menu, Go-to, Then scroll through the books of the bible.  Once you choose the book, you can select a chapter to start in, then flip the pages to get to the specific verse you are looking for.

1494,AJJHGK9FYCMW6,0842340351,"If you are after the NKJV version of the bible with study notes at a price that will not break the piggy bank, then this bible is a very good option.

I have used the NIV life application bible(Hardcover) in the past and enjoyed it very much. I wanted to try the NKJV Life Application version and after some research about the options for kindle, I decided to try this one. This review will refer mostly to the transfer of the bible resources onto Kindle as opposed to a discussion of the quality of the study notes etc.

Up Side

This bible has been very well formatted for kindle.

Study notes swap out to text and vice versa very well and things like searching for a verse is very quick if you know how to do it (Press Menu, go to Index, then type in verse you want using abbreviation. E.g. Mt 6 30 will take you to Matthew 6:30). This is the same as it would be for most other study bibles/commentaries I have tried like the ESV study bible or the Matthew Henry Commentary (Unabridged). It is so quick that I was able to use three different resources on my kindle to look at one passage of Scripture during my bible study without too much problem.

The harmony of the Gospels is also well thought out for Kindle. You do not view it in a table, but rather by events which you can scroll through with all relevant Scripture passages for each event listed under each heading.

To get to the Concordance, Personality Profiles, Maps, Charts, Study Notes or Cross References is not too crazy of a process. Press Menu, select Go To, select Table of Contents, scroll to the end of the contents and select your desired resource. This may seem a little involved but once you get used to it, it's actually quite quick. 5 seconds approximately.

I have not viewed all the maps, but some of the maps I looked at in Genesis were clear and I could read the place names on the maps clearly. As with the study notes, you can move the cursor to the references for Scripture passages that refer to various places on the map. This is pretty useful and has worked seamlessly for me so far.

When you are reading a passage in a particular book of the bible, you can use the left/right cursor button to look at the master index for the next book or the current book you are reading. This makes it a quick process to switch between chapters in a book. You don't have to be on the first page of a chapter to navigate to other chapters, you can be reading anywhere in a book to use this navigation tool. A definite plus!

Down Side
The only thing I did not enjoy too much was the timeline. If you know the Life APplication Bible, there is a time line at the beginning listing major events in the bible and history.

The beginner should go to a study Bible such as the Reformation Study Bible, MacArthur Study Bible, NKJV Study Bible, etc., that contain many, good, though imperfect and subjective notes.

The more seasoned reader should not be relying on any of these.

On the top half of each page you have the actual text of Scripture. On the bottom half of each page you have the study notes. The study notes are brief descriptions/interpretations of each individual verse. Of course not all verses are interpreted for us, largely due to space constraints. All the major verses are covered. What's really neat about this bible is that the study notes really help you to see how any particular verse of Scripture applies to you personally in your day to day life. It breaks each verse down so that it's easy to understand. Hence the name Life APPLICATION Study Bible. Another neat thing about this bible is that this bible is really right about down the middle as far as Theology is concerned. It's a bible that pretty much all denominations can agree with. Anyone from Petecostal Assemblies of God types, all the way to the other side of Southern Baptist Conservative types, or middle of the road Calvary Chapel types and everyone in between can enjoy and apprecaite. The reason this bible can be appreciated by such a wide variety of groups is not at all because it's wishy washy on Theology but, rather, it's simply because it majors on application. That's what's so great about it. Everyone from a brand new believer all the way to a well seasoned Bible Teacher or Pastor can greatly benefit from the study notes in this bible.

If you are looking for a more Doctrinally or Theologically centered bible then I higly recomend John Macarthur's ""The Macarthurs Study Bible. Or if you're more the Pentecostal type more centered on the gifts of the Spirit, try The ""New Spirit Filled Bible"" by Jack Hayford. If you're more on the Calvanist, Reformed Theology type then try the ""Reformation Study Bible"" by R. C. Sproul. I believe Chuck Smith has also recently come out with his own Study Bible for you Calvary Chapel types.

1579,A3IRTRPYAJ60XE,0955909619,"Its just what I have been looking for -- the whole textbook unabridged but maximized for interactive benefits by multimedia DVD-ROM.  While I value many of the features of QPunctureII, a similar product, this one simultaneous excels in its study tools for students and in its value as a reference for more experienced practitioners.  Searching and cross referencing is in fact much more rapid than in a standard printed text.  So after the first initial read, this is my favorite means to work with the material.  The printed text just can't implement all the features of the DVD.

There are well designed sections detailing out the anatomy of critical landmarks such as the spinous processes, ribs, and other bony landmarks.  It provides good coverage on precautions to take when needling near organs.  It contains both point-by-point information plus details of the major meridians, extraordinary points and chinese names.  Multi-media features include brief very good resolution videos of how to locate points on the human body plus chinese pronunciation of point names.  These are easily available at the touch of a link for every point.

It is quite flexible as a study tool, allowing one to practice locating points by identifying first the general body region, and then the underlying key anatomical structures that simulate what one would feel under the skin as depicted in the next deeper level of the drawing. (I wish it allowed one more optional layer for clarifying location of nearby nerves, blood vessels, muscles/ligament groups and their names -- with some way to rehearse these as well).  Practice tests can be configured as needed for studying particular meridians.  I especially like being able to contruct my own point combinations as desired for treating particular illnesses or regional pain problems.  One can focus this process to rehearse Chinese names, too.

The testing features makes studying more meaningful -- helps one identify where additional work is needed and builds confidence.  Given that every school seems to have a few of their own ""special"" pearls or point variations to learn -- it is extremely important to find a means to add in notes as well.  This program allows you to do so.

Deadman's Textbook/DVD multimedia program has already proven to be one of my favorite essential resources.  I expect it to be a companion for a long to come.  Physicians acupuncturists will need to be mindful that the points are understandably determined by WHO international nomenclature, and there will be small variations in preferred locations for some individualized purposes.

DRM Limitations

I previously agreed with another reviewer here about frustration regarding the DRM limitations.  These WERE quite annoying.  HOWEVER, the developers of the software have been extremely attentive to our concerns.  They have subsequently developed a patch which corrects this problem and allows the program to run disc-free.  At first it glance, it seemed to be a bit cumbersome to install -- but actually was quite easy.  It does require that the full version of the software from the original disc be installed first -- which was not a problem for me as that is how I had been running it all along.  Then a brief online validation with a key the developers provide allows it to be unlocked.  If one needs to change to another computer there is a provision for uninstalling and then reinstalling somewhere else again.  This provides pretty much everything I had wished for.

I am extremely grateful that Tom Kennedy and his team at JCM have provided their willingness to listen which led to the creation of this solution until the next version of the DVD is available.  You can write to them for the patch at: jcmdvdsupport(at)gmail.com

This patch has continued to work through the first several trial on my computer.  A few reboots, running other software and returning to MofA, as well as disconnecting from the internet after the initial registration/unlock was completed.  I am delighted to say that it is still working fine.

1580,AFTC8UJT0YZE7,0955909619,"First off, let me say that the content on this DVD-ROM is everything I'd hoped it would be.  Anyone familiar w/ Deadman's hardcopy text (which I also own) will know that the text is solid.  There are a wide variety of quizzes which are useful and well organized.  The videos for point location are great for to refresh your memory on the location of an obscure point you haven't used in several years.  If this was the whole story I would give this product 5/5 stars.

Unfortunately, this otherwise useful tool is shackled by unreasonable DRM.  For those unfamiliar with the term, DRM is technology used to limit the ways in which one can use software that has already been purchased.  In this case, the software requires that the DVD must ALWAYS be present in my computer in order to run the software.  This is incredibly inconvenient.  The main reason I bought this software was for its portability.  This is hampered if I must carry a fragile DVD with me to use it.  If I leave it in my DVD drive, then it makes extra noise when booting up and drains extra power from my laptop.  Also, it means my DVD drive is occupied and not available for other disks.  I would prefer to be able to keep the DVD safely in my office or at home, but this is not possible.  Hopefully nothing will happen to the disk.

My recommendation is to make do with the hardcopy text if you have it already.  The added benefits from the DVD don't compensate for the inconvenience of the DRM.  Also, if you need to use it in a quite place (such as a library or classroom) make sure your DVD drive is quiet, as mine (superdrive in a macbook pro) makes too much noise for these applications.",Softwares,2009-12-04,2,negative,first let say content dvdrom everything id hoped would anyone familiar w deadmans hardcopy text also know text solid wide variety quizzes useful well organized videos point location great refresh memory location obscure point havent several years whole story would give stars unfortunately otherwise useful tool shackled unreasonable drm unfamiliar term drm technology limit ways one software already purchased case software requires dvd must always present computer order run software incredibly inconvenient main reason bought software portability hampered must carry fragile dvd leave dvd drive makes extra noise booting drains extra power laptop also means dvd drive occupied not available disks would prefer able keep dvd safely office home but not possible hopefully nothing happen disk recommendation make hardcopy text already added benefits dvd dont compensate inconvenience drm also need quite place library classroom make sure dvd drive quiet mine superdrive macbook pro makes much noise applications,0.11702898550724639,positive,9.0,positive,positive

1582,A16JTNAEKD139I,0976888602,"This DVD collects all FF issues including annuals. The company has scanned in all the pages (including ads, Bullpen page, letter pages, and back cover) from actual issues. A few of the pages are scanned in slightly crooked, but this could also be the printing on the originals.

I thought it might be difficult reading the comics on a computer screen, but after a few pages I liked turning a page with the push of a button. If you have a bright monitor or laptop, the colors should look nice.

Make sure that you upgrade to Acrobat Reader 6 (included on the disk) so that the Marvel watermarks don't show on your screen. If you try to print a page the watermarks will (I believe) appear.

Overall, a wonderful addition for those who have the original issues (as I do) but can't read them because of their value, for those who don't want to buy a bunch of the Masterworks titles, for those who want to see the comics with the original colors and printing quality, and for those who want to read all the issues in color. The cost of the total collection may seem high, but think about buying over 550 comics. That's less than a dime an issue--more than I paid years ago!

1601,A33LH3ROCD8AY4,0982697813,"Before I start my review I want to say two things.  First off, I only give 5 star reviews to things that change my life.  Second, although I was raised Catholic, I am more interested in Christianity from the academic point of view.

Glo is by far the most amazing Christian tool I have ever used.  The artwork, maps, videos, etc that are linked to biblical scriptures brings the bible to life like nothing I have ever seen.  Bible study groups will love the topical sections which is an encyclopedia of relevant scriptures.  Students will love how easy it is to navigate and learn from the bible.  Anyone who wants to learn more about Christianity will find Glo to be a valuable tool.  I truly wish this was out during my Catholic School days.

Despite having a 5 start review, there are some things I would love to see added.  A timeline that followed Christianity through the present time.  A Christian Denomination option for an upgrade, or an add on (as an academic I would love to have links to different writings and additional texts of various denominations).  Inclusion of scriptures that did not make the NIV Bible.

Overall I feel that by using the Glo software, you will see Christianity in a whole new light.  Every person that I have shown this program to has gone out and bought it.  That says something about the quality of this product.

1602,ACJT8MUC0LRF0,0982697813,"Even though glo was the winner of the 2010 ECPA Bible of the Year award, the software was a bit buggy and there were many complaints, all of which have been addressed.  After a seamless, but lengthy installation (there is a tremendous amount of information being loaded) it didn't take me long to realize that glo was good to go.  The only minor glitch was that I had to install Roxio first.  If you've never installed a program you may need a bit of guidance, but for anyone else installation is quite simple.  Glo seriously listened to the user of the last version.

Things glo has improved upon:

++ They now have a help system that is both in and outside the program.  There are ""lenses"" that ""distribute content over a zoomable interface,"" media containers, a result's grid, basic and advanced searches, menus, and a link to online tutorials.  All of these are explained in the help menu with visuals to assist the user.

++  Glo has added online tutorials for those who would like an overview prior to either purchasing or using the software.

++  The user can check out the ""contributors and sources"" on the company website.  I did notice that when I clicked on information on Syria I was taken to an Wikipedia article on the web.

++  There is a ""Quick Install"" option (I didn't opt to use this one) and an uninstall option on your control panel.

++  When you start glo up it will immediately look for updates, something that most people will appreciate as it will keep your information from becoming dated or obsolete.

++ You can install glo on five personal devices,including PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad.

The only thing I didn't find was a user manual, something that I would have appreciated as would many other users.  Sometimes a user manual is greatly appreciated by those who are a little less high tech.  I can't fault glo as they are selling software and not manuals, but it would have been a nice touch.  With all the nice additions, I'll give a little bit of information on what you are getting.  If you already know you want this software, you can simply bypass the rest of this review.  In this ""revolutionary new Bible"" (NIV study Bible) you'll find an an amazing array of all aspects of Biblical lore from the historical aspects, to spirituality, the arts, and many more factual aspects you can weave into your own life and studies.

GLO features:

++  450+ Virtual Tours
  These are 360-degree tours of ""modern-day and re-created"" ancient biblical locations.""

++  3.5 Hours of HD Videos
  You'll be able to enjoy the ""In His Shoes"" HD interactive documentary.

++  2,300+ High Resolution Photos
  The zoom feature is a real plus when you want to look more closely at a photograph.

++  7,500+ Articles
  The large variety of articles will help you as you create your own Bible reading plan

Take for example when I wanted to take a look at Syria.  There was a columnar format that presented the information GLO had to offer provided I wanted to explore its relation to the Bible in my readings.  I was offered thirty-three scripture references, one internal article, twelve maps, and one web article.

++  650+ Works of Art

++  Integration with the best web content

++  Continual additions to the content each time you load the program

++  Concise, compact organization through five ""lenses""

++  You have the ability to journal and take notes as you study

LENSES:

BIBLE:  You can easily navigate and find the verse or chapter you want easily.

TIMELINE:  You can compare and contrast when many events occurred through time starting with the Creation

MyGlo:  This is where you will house all your notes, journal, bookmarks, and ""reading plans.""

MEDIA:  This area houses the videos, thousands of articles, photographs, artwork, maps, virtual tours, and more.

ATLAS:  This is a zoomable atlas where you can see the larger ""picture"" or zoom in to see a particular area of interest.

TOPICAL:  Here you can ""quickly find relevant verses and articles on thousands of key concepts.""

This is an astounding digital Bible experience that is well worth the money, especially given the improvements that have been made in the software.  If you simply browse someone else's program you'll certainly want to have a copy as it brings out the wow factor.  The one thing to keep in mind is that it does use the NIV version of the Bible by Biblica (copyright 1984), Zondervan, as I realize this is not the version of choice by all people.

From my perspective, I have taken a lot of time to get used to the interface and explore the features.  As somebody who is admittedly not an expert in the subject matter, I find the interactive features to add new dimensions to the content that is presented.  And considering the amount of investment required to produce software of this caliber, I think this program is a great value.

Many have reported installation problems.  For PC use, I can report that I had no problems installing this on Windows 7.  The program required that I install Microsoft .NET framework 4 first, and the related updates.  But as of November 2011, it seems like some of the installation problems have been fixed.

The initial install allows you to access the basic features, but you will need to register to use things like the Atlas.  The actual space required to install the software is about 1 GB for a PC and 200 MB for a Mac.  You can use the interface to stream the data off the internet, and while there is some lag it wasn't significant for me.  But yes, if you want all the files on your local hard drive you will need to use all 3 disks and it will take up about 18 GBs.  That seems like a small price to pay for those who choose to have all the content stored locally.

This product is advertised to work for multiple devices.  While I had no problem with a PC install, it seems getting it to work on a tablet or iPod requires separate installs.  I will update this further once I confirm that my license key works for all the devices.

The best features for me are the Atlas, which integrates historical content from the Bible with geographical data and images.  This is the kind of resource that I think would be very valuable when visiting the various regions of Europe, Africa and the Middle East depicted in the Bible.

CONCLUSION

This is a very good program.  Though it takes some time to learn the interface, I think it's worth the effort.

There are videos, articles, photos, artwork, and notes to go with every verse, every category, every topic. The Bible is also sorted into topics like Faith, Relationships, God, etc. and you can search for specific verses or articles within those topics.

There is a journal application where you can use a very simple word processor to make notes.

Glo is better than Ilumina in the sense that you can go to a chapter and verse in quick easy steps, and you can open multiple sessions of the Bible (and other lenses for that matter) at the same time.  Also, Glo lets you select a passage in the Bible and drop it to all of the lenses to see if anything in the passage is connected to the atlas, media, etc.

1621,A3TPNC3TKGCCEI,0982697813,"GLO is a visually stunning bible program with so much to offer. Gorgeous graphics, a unique interface, beautiful easy-on-the eyes bible pages, and so much more it's overwhelming. You can go from casual reading to in-depth historical research with a few clicks. There's so much to GLO...I'm still discovering stuff about it.

GLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff. Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.

GLO's gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu's darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple's love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.

Be forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I don't doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.

The one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really don't know how to process all this information. I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit. I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it. I did see a short video trailer about GLO and it just affirmed that there's so much that can be done with this program that I haven't conceived yet.

I'm also disappointed that there isn't a Strong's concordance or similar (or at least I haven't found it yet) to do word research on the Greek or Hebrew meaning. That's so automatic with so many other bible programs it's surprising not to find it with this one.

GLO is quite frankly mind-boggling! It offers so much that you are pretty much blown away. It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from. It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you. The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration.

Glo's features are listed in the Amazon's Product Description so I won't go into those.  I've been using this program off and on for a few weeks now. I think the loading time..switching between the lenses, topics, multi-media, etc..sometimes takes a few seconds  but is fairly quick for such a large program. If I ever become an owner of a tablet, IPod Touch or IPad, I plan on downloading the Glo Bible IPad app & syncing my notes and/or bookmarks to the device. I hope to prepare presentations for Children's Church. By the way, the collection of media in this program is amazing. There's HD video,  articles, photos, art, 360 degree virtual tours & more. I needed to use 'Help' to learn how to find my way around.

As a test,  I did a search for Galatians 5:22; first it turned up nothing, but then I did a search in Galatians & also on the home page both searches pulled up the verse, 2 photos and a map. Clicking on the verse took me to the Galations 5,  the highlighted Bible passage, study notes and a map. Clicking the photos brought up the photo, its description and other pertinent info.  Clicking on the map brought up even more information. By the way, the amount of information that is brought up can be overwhelming.

Check out The Glo Blog, News & Updates on All Things Glo, g l o b i b l e. com / blog/  to learn how to use Glo in your presentations, and the usefulness of the right-click context menu. Clicking on 'Features' at the top of the page might be helpful to you too. Be sure to use the 'help' menu in this program too. If the web address isn't showing in my review, just do a search for Glo Bible Blog to find the web page.

This program has many features, as I used it, I could only think that it needed a few more. To make this program perfect & even more useful to me, I'd like to see the following added:

Audible dictionary; I'd like to be able to click on a word, go to the definition & also hear how it's pronounced.

A few more Bible versions; currently it has NIV 1984 & 2010, KJV, The Message & ESV. I'd like to see NLT added. I'd also like the Bible versions in parallel format so I could read the same passage in different versions side-by-side.

I wish the Bible timeline also showed the events happening in world history.

And, I  wish the Life Application Notes were included.

In my opinion, adding these items would make this software perfect!

This program is huge with many, many interactive features; it can be overwhelming. Take your time, don't feel intimidated & soon you'll be comfortable with the wealth of information found in Glo Premium.

I did have a small problem loading the disc the first time. My Mac spit the disc back out, but the next time I put it in it took it just fine and installed perfectly. It was most likely user error, not an error on the disc.

1634,A334U1TZFY6SNO,0982697813,"It will take many weeks and even months to explore all the options and possibilities in Glo, but my initial response is this: Impressive! I've spent two weeks exploring the content every day, and I've barely scratched the surface. The Amazon product description and other reviewers have detailed Glo's content, so instead of repeating the description, I'll share my observations so far.

Overall evaluation--Despite some typos & grammatical errors, this is an impressive body of information. Not suited to objective research (see below) and useful only as a supplemental resource in academic settings, but excellent for personal use and/or evangelism support. Homeschool families in particular will love it.

BIBLE--Included are the traditional KJV and the popular NIV 1984, NIV 2010, ESV, MSG, versions accessible to laypersons and acceptable to conservative Bible readers. It's easy to toggle between versions for comparison. Study guide links to relevant excerpts from the Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible. ""YouVersion"" allows readers to add their own commentary to the study notes for each chapter, providing a sense of community and sharing.

TIMELINE--Significant dates from creation (which is identified as happening in 3950 B.C., with Adam and Eve placed at 2500 B.C.) to the death of John on Patmos in approximately 100 A.D.

ATLAS--Maps arranged chronologically; just click on the period. Captions tie key events to places, with some editorial comments. Sources would also have been welcome; for example, the map offers two possible locations for the Garden of Eden according to ""two main theories"" but does not identify or credit those theories.

TOPICAL--Index by ""cluster"" branching out from four main terms: God, The Bible, Faith, and Relationships. Each of these categories has a cluster of possible topics; for example, ""Faith"" leads to the headings Man, Sin, Spiritual Beings, The Church, End Times, Creation, Kingdom of God, Eternity, Evil, and Spiritual Warfare. Under ""Relationships"" --> ""With Myself"" --> ""Addictions"" --> ""Internet"" two of the three articles deal with sexual issues (pornography, cyberaffairs); the third linked article (on internet gambling) is available only to Christianity Today subscribers. No mention is made of other internet addictions such as online gaming, shopping, social media, etc.
So far I've found only links to conservative websites such as Focus on the Family and Lifeway. (Christianity Today is included but Christian Century is not). While the Glo content is presented as objective reference material, the selection of articles will be satisfactory to Christians who are pro-life or creationist or believe that homosexuality is a sin.

MEDIA--Virtual tours are particularly fascinating to explore--click for increasingly detailed insets nested one inside another. Choices are somewhat arbitrary; detail of the Mount of Olives identifies northeastern view, slopes, summit, Gethsemane, and Church of All Nations, but not the magnificent Church of Mary Magdalene clearly shown directly behind Gethsemane.

MY GLO--Lots of neat personalization options, such as a tool allowing reader to create drag-and-drop presentations. I particularly like the Bible Reading Plan, which let me set a goal and tailor a personal plan to reach it.

NOTE-- This review is the Mac version, which requires OS 10.5.8 or higher. I have OS 10.6.7 with nearly 400 GB available, which should have been plenty. Even with high-speed cable, installation took forever, and the installer crashed twice in process.

1644,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,0989614026,"It is important to note that this is not an actual CD, just a booklet that gives you the installation instructions and activation code.  The instructions however seem to be a bit outdated for the website.

You should first create a profile/account on the mathworks website.  It will ask you when you are creating the profile if you have a code to enter (this is optional at this point, but I did it and it ultimately worked fine) which will allow the product to activate after you download it.

In the instructions it says to download the MATLAB and Sumulink suite, but what it does not tell you however is to do that without paying for it again (there is a store on the website where you can pay the $99 to download it), you have to click the Support link at the bottom of the page.  After you do that, there is a button to download the software.

At the start of the download you will have to enter your school information.  During the process of creating an account you have to enter an email address which it will then require you to verify via a link sent to that email.  I just used my school email address, but it did not seem like you had to use an email ending in .edu at that point, I just did to make it easier.  When you start the download you will be required to tell it where you go to school, and then it will register and then the process of downloading and installing (which takes probably 20-25 min depending on your computer speed) and registering/activating your license.

After the process was complete I was able to open and use the product without any problems or any other verification of my status as a student.  Anyone who is enrolled in any kind of engineering program with likely have to use MATLAB in at least a couple classes.  I am in an online/distance program and my school went from giving us relatively easy access to MATLAB through citrix, to having to remote into the computer lab computers on campus to use it, which made it insufferably slow on my newer laptop, and impossible to access on my older desktop.

The difference is in knowing what documents are needed and what strategy needs to be followed in setting up your estate plan.  This is where the lawyer earns his (or her) fees.  The lawyer can evaluate your situation and advise you on the best legal approach for you.

1694,AEVSRK7S3K8QU,1413313701,"When reviewing software, nothing ruins the experience more quickly than a failed installation.  I encountered two installation problems with WillMaker: 1) Clicking the 'Register your product' button takes me to Nolo's page for buying the 2013 edition of WillMaker, and instructions for registering the 2011 product are nowhere to be seen; 2) Clicking the 'Web Update' button that offers to download updates for the 2011 version installs files that break the program's ability to launch.

Granted, I am reviewing and installing the 2011 edition of WillMaker, and the current version is for 2013.  That being said, the online notification assured me that 2011 online updates would be available to me through the end of 2012 (and the installer does indeed install something, albeit a bad something).  I uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and hit the same failure twice.  I uninstalled again, then reinstalled without requesting the online update.  This worked.  Still, I view this to be a huge black eye for the product.  Additional salt was rubbed into my wound when I followed the link for a free online living trust that is advertised on the box.  I instead received a notification that the offer had expired (despite the fact that no expiration date is listed anywhere on the packaging).

WillMaker then offered to help me create a bunch of documents, and estate planning documents like a will are only one category of what is offered.  Being offered documents beyond the expected estate planning documents is not a negative, but was somewhat confusing given the program's name.  I guess this is what puts the ""plus"" into WillMaker Plus.  Perusing the box, I see that these extra documents are indeed part of the promised functionality, therefore, no marks off for my (brief) confusion here.

I then jumped into the meat of what I assume most customers want from WillMaker, i.e., the wizard that helps one to create a will.  You are presented with a checklist outline that explains what the process will be, and then you are walked through a series of dialogs which query you for your personal information and desires for your will.  Each page has a right pane with additional information for each question that you need to answer.  Everything seemed straightforward here, so high marks for the data entry aspect of WillMaker.

After answering all the questions, you are presented with an on-screen draft of your will which you may subsequently print.  The on-screen instructions explain that you need to sign it with two witnesses to make it legally binding.  I have to accept on faith that the legal quality of this will is sufficient to cause my estate wishes to be executed according to my desires.  It seems to me that the prudent consumer would pay an estate lawyer to review the job done by WillMaker.  I also suspect that there are free online boilerplates that would allow me to craft a similar document.

Another area of uncertainty for me is the trade offs between a living trust and a will.  Granted, WillMaker is designed to create a will, not a trust.  But if we ignore the semantic implications of the product name, what the consumer really wants from this product are the documents that control the disposition of one's property after death.  To not devote even one yes/no question to ""do you perhaps need a trust rather than a will?"" seems like a serious flaw to me.

In summary, I found WillMaker Plus 2011 to be underwhelming despite receiving it for free via Amazon Vine.  The installation problems are totally unacceptable.  And the final output document leaves me feeling like I need to visit an estate lawyer to review the result.  If the price of WillMaker plus the cost of reviewing a WillMaker-generated set of documents is less than having the estate lawyer create the same set of documents from scratch, then this product pays for itself.

As far as programming is concerned its application reminds you of the basic text only style; no fancy graphics here. I don't say that to detract the value of the program. For example the legal manual provides legal and practical answers to help you create specific documents.

I have been a fan of Quicken/Intuit products for well over a decade or more, and now have also been a fan of NOLO books; they are so beneficial at this point I have a library of them. This is a joint effort by those two powerhouse entities.

For the cost of admission this program will at the very least provide you with a set of decisions you will need to make when creating your will if not sufficient thoroughness in order to provided you with the actually final document itself. Personally if you have a large family, or a complicated situation, I wouldn't hesitate to seek out professional legal counsel to avoid a lot of heartaches later to those you love.",Softwares,2012-01-28,5,positive,super fast install windows includes small book called legal companion gives pages topic total pages many topics list but good reference first read getting situation wasnt able download nolos encyclopedia everyday law chose option instead law forms personal version would advise getting one insteadnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefquickenwillmakerpluseditionbooksoftwarekitdprefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieutf8quicken willmaker plus edition book software kita instead going specifics already well covered reviews chose share additional material qwp2011 instead far programming concerned application reminds basic text style no fancy graphics dont say detract value program example legal manual provides legal practical answers help create specific documents fan quickenintuit products well decade also fan nolo books beneficial point library joint effort two powerhouse entities cost admission program least provide decisions need make creating not sufficient thoroughness order provided actually final document personally large family complicated situation wouldnt hesitate seek professional legal counsel avoid lot heartaches later love,0.12281746031746037,positive,15.0,positive,positive

1703,A3NIOJ1U8JT9DN,1413313701,"I just finished my will and other estate and personal documents:  Will, declaration of trust, advanced directives, durable power of attorney (finances), general durable power of attorney (attorney-in-fact), and medical durable power of attorney.  I used WillMaker and found it to be as advertised.  However, by the time I had prepared all documents, enough questions had arisen that I decided to contact a local attorney for help with answers.  In numerous places of the WillMaker instructions, the user is informed that contacting an attorney might be necessary and is a good idea if needed.  I learned a number of very important estate-protecting things from the attorney that I could not have learned in WillMaker (tips from an insider, one might say).  I also learned that several of the state-specific forms provided by WillMaker were quite far from ideal - not incorrect, just prepared and formatted in ways that could cause problems and delays for my estate executor and beneficiaries.  After my second meeting with the attorney, I had the opinion that I could have saved myself one hell of a lot of work had I gone to him in the first place.  I paid the attorney for his good services - including all that horrible witness signing and notarization business for which I have no stomach.  The cost for for having him do it all would have been under $300.  To me, given all the time I spent doing the initial work on WillMaker, the necessary change work I did on WillMaker after consulting the attorney, and all the yuck I would have gone through on my own getting notarization & witnessing of documents, the better alternative would have been to have the attorney do it all in the first place.  By the way, I found that once I committed to the WillMaker approach, making document changes recommended by the attorney was not such a simple thing (formatting issues using the WillMaker's ready-made templates).  So I think that WillMaker is a good product, but before you decide to go the WillMaker route, ask yourself if it is likely that you will want or need to consult with an attorney anyway (if only to ensure that everything is exactly right - not just legally right - for your executor and beneficiaries) and if you have the paper-management skills and patience to complete the project on your own.

1717,A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,1413313701,"I have Nolo products I bought in the past and I have used Quicken since their first version (I got it from the original owners of the company in person).  Nolo makes (made) some valuable applications but they tend to look like something you would find in MSDOS 3.0.  Quicken, on the other hand has a very slick and easy to understand user interface.

WillMaker Plus is very much a Nolo product. Although it contains the basic forms you buy it for, the user interface is so basic it looks like something you would find on PC's from the 1980's.  The willmaking app (the part that most people buy this for) consists of 7 questions.  Seriously, that's it. You are allowed to enter only what the software will let you enter and there are some really basic non-interactive guidelines that are at the same time too basic and also too confusing.

I wrote my own will in about 10 minutes, but the software didn't permit me to include ANY specific details for someone to know what my ""final intentions"" are. I can't imagine anyone having such a basic lifestyle as to just say ""give it all to so-and-so"".  I think anyone could just hand-write that sort of thing on a piece of paper and hand it to their next of kin.  I expected the software to be more like TurboTax in that it would interview me about what the provisions of my mortgage are, what and where my investments are, what and where my life insurance policies are, what I owe and how to pay that off, what special provisions I may have for friends who are not in my will but who I may want to leave certain things that they've admired to.  But no.  None of the above.  Just 7 questions and a print-out of something that to me really has no practical value.

I think Quicken is doing themselves a disservice to put their name on this product. It's not worth the 35 bucks and especially not worth the ""list price"" of 70. There are hundreds of websites you can go to and download a simple will form that will be just as useful to you as WillMaker Plus.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that it does give you the convenience of having some basic forms all on one disk, a bit of a timesaver.

1722,A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,1413313701,"This is the third version of Quicken Willmaker Plus I have used.  I liked the 2009 version.  Unfortunately, starting with the 2010 version, Nolo, the publisher of self-help legal books that produces this software, took away the living trust feature, which was a terrible move.  (Also, you're supposed to upgrade to a new version *every year*.  If you don't, the software won't update itself after the end of the version year -- i.e., Dec. 31, 2011 for the 2011 version -- which can cause problems as states [such as New York] do update their probate and other estate-related laws.)

This 2011 version does not come with the living trust feature, either, but does provide you with a link upon installation to access Nolo's online living trust product for free. This was probably in response to the uproar from their loyal customer base last year. While this does mitigate the problem somewhat -- living trusts are an essential part of estate planning for most people and must be included in an estate toolkit -- it means none of the information you enter in Willmaker Plus 2011, such as all the contact names and addresses and birthdays and phone numbers, carries over to the living trust part, essentially making you have to enter all that information again.

Other than that, both the Willmaker itself and the online living trust software are solid estate planning products.  Of course, tools like this are best for simple situations.  How simple?  For example, in my case I'd like to attach a condition to my will that the people I'd like to be the personal custodians for my kids only become custodians if they relocate to my city.  It turns out I cannot do this in Willmaker.  What I have to do is go through the standard Q&A process of Willmaker, export the draft to Word, and then add the condition in Word myself.  This part is easy; the hard -- real hard -- part is I now need to pore over my state's will law to make sure my language is kosher.  I already know the condition itself is fine; I just have to make sure the way I write it -- since Willmaker didnt' write it for me -- will pass on probate.

For most families without complicated familial situations -- such as history of multiple divorces and remarriages or estranged children -- Willmaker Plus 2011 will be good for making wills, living wills (aka healthcare directives), powers of attorney, etc.  You can also write promissory notes and some other simple legal documents beyond wills.

Another thing I'm disappointed with Nolo and this version -- again I think Nolo is using the product as a cash cow rather than to really help its customers -- is it's little changed from the 2009 version, or even the earlier version I had used before.  The same typos (yes, TYPOS!) remain, and the same interface remains.  It seems every year they just change the update-expiration date of the program and the splash screen, and then sell it as a new version.  (And the price seems to have been going up, even though now it doesn't come with living trusts built-in.)  I find this practice unethical.

Most likely this will be the last version of Willmaker I'll use.  I wasn't going to use the 2011 version, but got a chance to try it for free, hence I used it and this review.  There're books out there that show you step-by-step how to make wills and living trusts, books published by Nolo and by big-name publishers.

1723,A3HGTTFIDLCWDJ,1413313701,"I wrote a review when I first used the 2011 version, and then erased it. I just went back to modify my Health Care Proxy, which is one of the documents this software provides in addition to the Will. I had forgotten how cumbersome it is to navigate through the meager 4 or 5 pages of this document, and how difficult it is to print. Without counting print pages carefully (and it's very cumbersome to that in their layout), you'll waste alot of paper.

I also find the ""help"" and suggestions for dealing with issues in the Health Care Proxy or the Will itself, to have a downside. It's supposed to give you an example, but if you don't think of things in detail for yourself, it will only open a can of worms, confuse you and result in awkward and inadequate statements of intent. So in the end I wonder, what good is this software, if it's always telling you to seek legal advice, you have to think long and hard about all your stuff and what to say and not say, and it's an absolute bear to print out? The answer must be, it's cheap and has the veneer of legal validity, it provides a framework I guess. Others seem to like it, and in fact I'm using it for now, but it could be better.

I find Intuit software in general, to not be a good organizing tool, but something you need to not let organize you, while you make the effort to organize yourself. The big example here is Quicken, I have an old 2000 version and it's really just a register for you to input finances, not an organizing or accounting tool at all.

Especially good, was the explanation of the duties and responsibilities and even options of the Personal Representative or individuals appoints as a Power of Attorney.

1803,A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE,1413313728,"This Windows ""program"" is a hodge-podge amalgamation of a variety of eBooks, PDFs, and help guides without integration and coordination.  Confusion was the only consistent theme in this application.  Put out by Quicken, the documents are actually created by Nolo, which is a trusted source of legal information.  I'd suggest buying their books instead.

The program includes sections on: Buying or Selling a Business; Contracts for Goods and Services; Corporate Minutes and Consents; Forming a Business; Hiring Workers; Leasing Space; LLC Minutes and Consents; Managing Finances; Buying and Selling Real Estate; and Tax Forms.

In these sections, instead of giving you a handy Microsoft Word Document that you can fill in obvious blanks on, the program makes you go through a step by step interview and often doesn't remember the information you enter from one form to another so you must enter your name, the name of the business and so forth all over again.  Nor does it integrate with any contact managers so you can easily fill in from there.  When your interview is complete, the document saves only in text or RTF format, which are highly compatible with most programs but at this point, .doc is pretty standard.

Many of the items in these sections are simply Adobe Acrobat forms without the ability to edit or annotate them unless you have something besides Acrobat reader.

Included in the program are ""checklists""  that are very short guides on very weighty subjects such as ""How to Form an LLC"" and ""How to Set Up Tax Reporting and Accounting"".  All these checklists do though is point you to other Nolo books or websites and are unable to offer any advice in and of themselves.  In other words, pretty much worthless.

Most frustrating to me was the business library which were simple PDFs (or Windows antiquated ""Book Reader"" format of:  Starting & Running a Small Business; Tax Savvy for Small Business; The Manager's Legal Handbook; How to Write a Business Plan; and Business Loans From Family and Friends.  Unfortunately, these books were previous versions and the newest versions of these books (despite the 2011 in the title of the program) are available elsewhere.

Additionally, also included with the program is a printed book called ""Your Little Legal Companion"" that has absolutely nothing to do with business and contains basic personal legal information that borders on the silly such as ""Moving in with your Lover"" and ""Getting Old."" These tidbits of advice had little substantive or legal value and were more like a sidebar from a Sunday newspaper magazine than anything that could be used for real reference or planning.

Upon registering the book, Nolo will send you a PDF of their book ""101 Law Forms for Personal Use"".  Again, this is just a PDF and not any templates that can actually be used within a program.

Combined together the program is a good value for all that you are getting.  However if you don't really need all that or want the current versions, I recommend purchasing this collection of eBooks and PDFs individually.",Softwares,2011-01-08,2,negative,windows program hodgepodge amalgamation variety ebooks pdfs help guides without integration coordination confusion consistent theme application put quicken documents actually created nolo trusted source legal information id suggest buying books instead program includes sections buying selling business contracts goods services corporate minutes consents forming business hiring workers leasing space llc minutes consents managing finances buying selling real estate tax forms sections instead giving handy microsoft word document fill obvious blanks program makes go step step interview often doesnt remember information enter one form another must enter name name business forth integrate contact managers easily fill interview complete document saves text rtf format highly compatible programs but point doc pretty standard many items sections simply adobe acrobat forms without ability edit annotate unless something besides acrobat reader included program checklists short guides weighty subjects form llc tax reporting accounting checklists though point nolo books websites unable offer advice words pretty much worthless frustrating business library simple pdfs windows antiquated book reader format starting running small business tax savvy small business managers legal handbook write business plan business loans family friends unfortunately books previous versions newest versions books despite title program available elsewhere additionally also included program printed book called little legal companion absolutely nothing business contains basic personal legal information borders silly moving lover getting old tidbits advice little substantive legal value sidebar sunday newspaper magazine anything could real reference planning upon registering book nolo send pdf book law forms personal pdf not templates actually within program combined together program good value getting however dont really need want current versions recommend purchasing collection ebooks pdfs individually,0.04094696969696969,negative,16.0,positive,positive

- Simple and straightforward installation
- Easy to use
- Extensive collection of forms
- While I haven't had the time to read it all, the Nolo business books is a great point of reference

CONS:
- fill-in process is required.  IMO it would be much easier to input the information directly into the document.
- no index of documents
- could not find any way to export information to other file formats.

1806,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,1413313728,"Before reading on, please note that the newer, updated version (2012) is now available for less --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quicken-Legal-Business-Pro-2012/dp/B005CELLZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quicken Legal Business Pro 2012</a>. (Today, the price is just $26 for the updated version)

That said, I have not looked at the 2012 version, but it claims to have everything the old version has plus more. So I'll go ahead and comment on the old version we've used:

First, most (probably all) of these forms can be found online for free. The real estate & leasing contracts, for example, can be found on your state realtors web site, or your state's bar association web site. Contracts for goods & services can be found on your state web site (department of motor vehicles for a bill of sale for a car, etc). But if you're like me and don't have time to browse, surf & download, here they are offered on one disc for a pretty reasonable price.

I will also add, most of these forms are what you see on Nolo.com, usually on sale for $15-$20 each. So if you've ever downloaded a form or contract from Nolo, you can get a couple hundred forms here for the price of 2. They claim this contains $900 worth of forms (real estate & leases, bill of sale, service contract & invoicing, paperwork for hiring employees, corporate minutes, IRS tax forms, sample forms for corporate policies, and a few more).

All of that said, this is nowhere near exhaustive - if you are run a fairly straightforward service or contracting business, or are a sole proprietor, this might meet many of your needs. But if you have a corporation (even an LLC), this software is insufficient.

I don't really agree with the reviewers who say this will save you legal fees - I don't know anyone who hires a lawyer to write such simple forms. There is nothing here that saved us any legal fees.

Also, none of the forms were usable ""as-is"" for me. Fortunately they can be customized, but I ended up adding huge addendums to any form I used. And, most of these forms are very common, we already had form letters on the computer for most of these topics (we store form letters online for free on our Google Docs account - saves file space, never worry about a crashed hard drive, and any employee can access & download a blank form from anywhere in the world, for free).

Nonetheless I still give this 3.5 to 4 stars. For me, it's all about saving time. There were a few useful things on here, which saved me an hour or two, so it's not perfect but it deserves a decent rating.",Softwares,2012-01-26,4,positive,reading please note newer updated version available less nbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefquickenlegalbusinessprodpb005cellzmrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieutf8quicken legal business pro today price updated version said not looked version but claims everything old version plus ill go ahead comment old version weve first probably forms found online free real estate leasing contracts example found state realtors web site states bar association web site contracts goods services found state web site department motor vehicles bill sale car etc but youre dont time browse surf download offered one disc pretty reasonable price also add forms see nolocom usually sale youve ever downloaded form contract nolo get couple hundred forms price claim contains worth forms real estate leases bill sale service contract invoicing paperwork hiring employees corporate minutes irs tax forms sample forms corporate policies said nowhere near exhaustive run fairly straightforward service contracting business sole proprietor might meet many needs but corporation even llc software insufficient dont really agree reviewers say save legal fees dont know anyone hires lawyer write simple forms nothing saved us legal fees also none forms usable asis fortunately customized but ended adding huge addendums form forms common already form letters computer topics store form letters online free google docs account saves file space never worry crashed hard drive employee access download blank form anywhere world free nonetheless still give stars saving time useful things saved hour two not perfect but deserves decent rating,0.12450980392156866,positive,17.0,positive,positive

1838,AWT4RE7CDDV24,1418516805,"This product was previously released under the name ""Thomas Nelson Study Reference Library"" for about the same price.  I could not believe that this offer was real, but it was!  You truly get what is advertised.  In fact, I am still amazed at the extensive amount and quality of the information made available through this product.

The library is based on Libronix search technology.  For this reason, there is really no limit to the books that can be added.

Installation of the library is not quite straightforward.  There is a registration step that is mandatory before the product registration grace period expires.  It is essential that you back up the registration codes!  I wrote them on the CD label, and am glad that I did when I had to reinstall the software later following a hard drive crash.

Another challenge is in installing the books on your hard drive, which you will probably want to do since hard drive space is far less of an issue than it used to be.  The installation of the software does not install all of the books as well--this is a manual step.  The drop-down menus are complex and somewhat confusing, so you will need to read and follow the instructions carefully.

You will find that a lot of Nelson Publisher's information is redundant between books, so that when you search for a narrow topic and find the results in five different books, all five books are likely going to say almost the same thing.  However, what they do say is quite useful.

One of the most outstanding uses that I have found from this library is the KJV expository by word, with word-for-word references to Greek and Hebrew equivalents.  A full expository research can be quickly performed on any Biblical text.  With full Vine's and Strong's resources integrated into the product, this becomes an indispensable study reference library.

The SFL books are great study resources for Bible study groups or personal edification.

Perhaps the greatest accolade that I can give this product is that, despite a year of heavy use, I have yet to access all of the information available in this library--not because it is hard to access, but simply because I just haven't had the time to explore the myriad of information available!",Softwares,2006-12-13,5,positive,previously released name thomas nelson study reference library price could not believe offer real but truly get advertised fact still amazed extensive amount quality information made available library based libronix search technology reason really no limit books added installation library not quite straightforward registration step mandatory registration grace period expires essential back registration codes wrote cd label glad reinstall software later following hard drive crash another challenge installing books hard drive probably want since hard drive space far less issue installation software not install books wellthis manual step dropdown menus complex somewhat confusing need read follow instructions carefully find lot nelson publishers information redundant books search narrow topic find results five different books five books likely going say almost thing however say quite useful one outstanding uses found library kjv expository word wordforword references greek hebrew equivalents full expository research quickly performed biblical text full vines strongs resources integrated becomes indispensable study reference library sfl books great study resources bible study groups personal edification perhaps greatest accolade give despite year heavy yet access information available librarynot hard access but simply havent time explore myriad information available,0.09232456140350877,negative,15.0,positive,positive

1842,A3FDKXH94W5VNK,1426296355,"I've been playing around with this latest version of the ""Complete National Geographic"" and have a few thoughts to share.

I own one of the previous sets on CD-ROM. That set had a couple significant problems: You couldn't read the text of the articles, and all the magazines were scanned badly.

This set has solved the readability and resolution problems, but has introduced a few of its own.

The earlier issues of the magazine have their photographs printed vertically so that the whole height of the page was used to display landscape photographs. With the magazine, and the earlier set on CD-ROM, you could rotate the pictures on their side and enjoy the whole photo blown up to full, (although limited), resolution. This set has no such feature, so you have to tip your head to view the photo and read the caption, and worse still, the photo can be displayed no wider than your monitor is tall. You can zoom in on the picture for a better look, but it would have been nice to be able to rotate the pages so you could get a full screen view.

Also, the search function is a sorry joke on this set. It uses these funky dials to select your date range, (what is wrong with pull downs I ask?), so it is more difficult to select an exact date range. Also, when you get your results they are displayed in this ""carousel"" format with the newest results first and the oldest rotating off into the distance. What is wrong with a simple list view and a scroll bar???

As was mentioned in an earlier review, these search results are truncated, so you know nothing about the date, or the key words, or anything about the details of the results. A good search function is kinda important for a collection spanning 120 years, and this one is close to worthless.

Ah, just remembered something else about the search function. When you search for a particular brand name in the advertisements, clicking on the result takes you to the cover of the issue the ad is in rather than the exact page. Very annoying!

So, all in all, better than the old set in one very important way, the scans seem much improved, but the interface needs some serious work.

I did notice that when I checked for updates it had already gone from version 1.12 to 1.15 in the short time since release. Maybe they will see the light and invest some effort into improving the interface. They have already got my money though, so I won't be holding my breath.",Softwares,2009-11-04,3,positive,ive playing around latest version complete national geographic thoughts share one previous sets cdrom couple significant problems couldnt read text articles magazines scanned badly solved readability resolution problems but introduced earlier issues magazine photographs printed vertically whole height page display landscape photographs magazine earlier cdrom could rotate pictures side enjoy whole photo blown full although limited resolution no feature tip head view photo read caption worse still photo displayed no wider monitor tall zoom picture better look but would nice able rotate pages could get full screen view also search function sorry joke uses funky dials select date range wrong pull downs ask difficult select exact date range also get results displayed carousel format newest results first oldest rotating distance wrong simple list view scroll bar mentioned earlier review search results truncated know nothing date key words anything details results good search function kinda important collection spanning years one close worthless ah remembered something else search function search particular brand name advertisements clicking result takes cover issue ad rather exact page annoying better old one important way scans seem much improved but interface needs serious work notice checked updates already gone version short time since release maybe see light invest effort improving interface already got money though wont holding breath,0.062057387057387066,negative,8.0,positive,negative

1844,A2YHVSGH6OS8QT,1426296355,"Overall, I am very impressed and pleased with this set. There are a few minor things that bother me, however, things that are not explained and given workarounds for due to there only being a 1-sheet program installation page.

1. There is no instuctions booklet provided in the box. There is an onscreen FAQ of sorts, but it doesn't begin to cover everything you need to know, making a booklet a must-have.

2. Many pages have their photographs oriented and displayed vertically onscreen. If a function exists on the installation disc to make them appear horizontally side-by-side I can't find it. Having to turn my head sideways to view these vertical pictures/read the text every so often is sure hard on my neck! LOL

2. No explanation (that I can find) is available on how to access/display the maps.

3. As was mentioned previously in this thread, each magazine page must be zoomed manually since there's no option to lock the screen at a given magnification for as long as it's needed. This is a programming oversight that should have been addressed, prior to this shipping out to retail.

All in all, owning this Nat-Geo set is proving to be a fascinating and worthwhile trip down memory lane.

[...]

(If Amazon doesn't allow this link here, check one of my responses below this review -- I'll include it there too and maybe it can stay there.)

One of the biggest negatives with this set is that the sideways pictures can't rotate, making them hard to read and enjoy. And there are many such pictures. Hopefully they will come up with an upgrade soon to fix this, as they have received many queries about this.

Although there are some negatives, overall, I am very happy with this set.

The huge plus is you get every issue of National Geographic in a relatively easily readable format when you use the easy-to-use magnifying and dragging features. If you have a 24"" monitor, it's pretty readable as is. With magnified reading, when you go to the next page, it resets back to zero magnification, and you have to re-magnify it. But it's fairly easy -- all you have to do is double click on the page, and it magnifies, and you can drag the text and pictures around as needed.

They even include all of the advertisements, which they could have easily decided to omit. (It's fun to look at the ads from long ago. For example, in the April 1916 issue, focusing on the national parks, there's an ad for newly established Cascade National Park, placed by Great Northern Railroad, reminiscent of the days when railroads affiliated themselves with different parks, to boost travel.)

It prints out beautifully, and there is no readability problem with printouts.

There is a handy readlist feature, where you can create your own readlists (very easily done) or look at readlists that the editors have prepared. There are approximately 33 of these already created readlists, covering such things as various editors' favorites, National Parks, The Universe, The Untamed, etc. Just scanning through these articles, it looks like these lists are pretty good and I see a lot of things I want to read.

One problem with these readlists is that they don't give the date of the article. You see something focusing on, say India, and you have no idea if it is from 1915 or 2005. That makes a big difference to me insofar as my interest. They should include the date of the issue in these readlists. When I create my own lists I plan on always including the date.

>>The CNG has poor quality control and customer support over this product. It relies heavily on customer feedbacks to become aware of missing pages and issues, and took very long time (18 months) to address few of the reported bugs. The Complete National Geographic will be incomplete with missing items such as:
- Jul 1942 and Feb 1992: Pages missing, causing pagination problems in the issues with double page spreads not appearing on facing pages.
- Mar 1996: Page 35 is missing.
- From 1991 to 2008, at least 30 maps are reported missing. Examples: The World War II double map supplement is missing from Dec 1991. The Sep 2000 map is missing. The ""100 Years of Flight"" supplement in Dec 2003 is missing. The Jerusalem's Holy Ground map is missing in Dec 2008.

>>The Complete National Geographic contains National Geographic Magazine published through Dec 2008. National Geographic announced ""The Complete National Geographic"" users will be able to add to their collection after purchasing the product by downloading annual updates on a subscription basis from the internet. Content updates for CNG will be available after the print editions of the previous year have been published. CNG released an updated edition of this DVD set and a 2009 annual update DVD ($14.95) in Sep 2010. The feature to purchase annual updates online wasn't ready until CNG patch 1.65 (requires Adobe Air 2.6) released in Apr 2011.

National Geographic, I expect nothing less than a FULL REFUND and/or a FULLY FREE copy of this DVD collection when you finally manage to get it right and rerelease this, again.

WRONG! Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE SOFTWARE, IT IS SIMPLY FRUSTRATING EVEN FOR EXPERIENCED COMPUTER USERS.

And this on a brand new Macbook Pro. Fail! The text is UNSEARCHABLE because NG- unbelievably - scanned all those magazines improperly at such low quality and haven't, it seems, gone back to try to fix this root of so many problems.

My father-in-law was Maynard Owen Williams, who served as Chief of the Foreign Editorial Staff of NGS, and whose articles and photographs were published between 1918 - 1953.  I was looking for a particular article he had written, published in the December 1927 issue, entitled East of Suez to the Mount of the Decalogue.  I found it easily and was able to print out this article in its entirety.

Installation of the Complete National Geographic required installation of a free Adobe product called AIR.  This was not difficult to do. The Complete National Geographic installation was a bit more complex, but I had no problems in installing it.

The nice part about this collection is that every issue of the magazine is reproduced as exactly as possible (barring some ""printing"" errors here and there):  every page, complete with ads, and all photos vividly reproduced, representing over 50GB of material.

The bad part is that every issue of this magazine is reproduced exactly:  they are issues that you flip through, page by page, with a Table of Contents.  The interface takes some getting used to, and the search engine leaves a bit to be desired.  The program can also be a little slow to respond, particularly when it first loads.

I'm curious if anyone has tried the following techniques to rotate your screen image:

1. The simplest approach, for Windows users, is try the built-in Ctrl + Alt + [Arrow Key] hot-key sequences available on many PCs.  Ctrl + Alt + [right, down, or left arrow key] will rotate the screen display clockwise. Ctrl + Alt + up arrow will return the display to normal.

2. There is a free download ""iRotate"" offered by EnTech Taiwan which provides access via a pop-up screen & is accessible from the system tray once installed.

3. Right-click an empty spot on the desktop & select ""Properties"" to bring up properties for the display. There may be an option to rotate the screen among the various settings available. However, this approach is less convenient as you generally have to go through the same motions to set it back to normal.

1893,A1IN3AZD6NZRSG,1426296355,"I'm not saying anything in this review that hasn't been said in many of the other reviews and in more detail.  After drooling about the CD-based offering of this product quite a few years ago, but not buying, I ran across this for $35 at an un-named retail chain, and I happily laid out the cash for it.

Who hasn't spent hours and hours as a kid or even an adult, just thumbing through issue after issue of National Geographic, being transported to places and times so fantastic, they almost seemed like fairy tales.

The content of these disks is phenomenal.  Over 120 years of incredibly interesting and well-researched stories and content we've come to know and love from National Geographic Society, conveniently loaded on 6 DVD's, providing super-easy access for endlessly entertaining reading and browsing.

But that being said, that was the no-brainer portion of creating this product, which would be hard to get wrong.  The ""goods"" were there, they only needed to transform the media.  Just scan and digitize each page of roughly some 1400 issues.  Not a fun process, I'm sure, but easily doable with today's technology.

Next step?  Determine some storage media that easily lets folks peruse that bountiful bunch of data.  DVDs are a logical choice given DVD players-readers are ubiquitous on PCs and laptops nowadays.

Last step?  Design a user interface that lets people as efficiently and effectively as possible access and explore all that wonderful content they so painstakingly transformed into this digital format.

And unfortunately, THIS is where they seriously dorked it up.  They had the Mona Lisa and bought a cheapo frame from Wall-Mart to put it in...yeah, that wry, semi-smirking face still looks good, but it's not the treatment the lady deserves.  Possibly inspired by some other software, it seems NGS decided to design a search and browsing interface from the ground up.  When it works, it's not a BAD interface, BUT IT'S BUGGY AS HECK!  It freezes half the time when I try to open a specific issue to browse (exiting the software and relaunching it usually fixes that).  The search engine/interface is frequently slow--and not just because of the DVD spin-up lag--and frequently freezes up as well.  I downloaded and installed the updates, and although it helped a bit, those aforementioned problems still exist.  When I activate the zooming bar to zoom in and out of the page image (which hovers over the page image), and I click on it to drag the zooming bar, it grabs and moves the page underneath it instead. They could have studied Microsoft Encarta (which isn't fabulous, but it is effective) or something similar and made a MUCH more usable interface.  Of course they could actually fix the bugs in this product as it is and EASILY improve it as well.

What the heck was NGS thinking?  The only REAL work needed to make this a great product was a nice, stream-lined, browsing interface that let people simply enjoy the product they've slowly crafted over the last 120 years.  How could they ignore the last critical piece of the project, and rush this thing to market?  Ouch.  And given the fact other reviews indicated these problems from late last year (2009) and they STILL haven't been fixed as of May 2010, it's WAY bad mark on their reputation for quality that NGS should value more than this product indicates they do.

Lastly, I somewhat agree with the comments about the text quality.  Easily think it could have been better, but for me it's fairly readable after some zooming.

Even with all the above-mentioned problems, and several content omissions ID'ed in several other reviews, this is a very good product.  But that's because of 120 years of hard work, the writers, photographers, and editors put into producing National Geographic...NOT the production team who put together this DVD product.  Had both parts been equally awesome (if that's even possible), 10 stars wouldn't have been enough for this product.  Shame on you NGS...get your act together.

Bottom line:  though problematic, for only $45 having 98% of ALL of the National Geographic issues at your finger-tips is too much to pass up.

And even on a high-end system (mine is an i7 3.6ghz with 8gb memory), the interface runs like a slug.

The buttons don't depress either, and the disabled buttons look almost identical to enabled buttons. Combined with the sluggish interface, you can't really tell if clicking is doing anything. Worse still is the search. The designers apparently felt that having a stack of magazines in front of you is the ideal interface because this search stinks. Trying to locate a map of mountains of Greece turned up a small result set of articles that had nothing to do with either Greece or mountains. But the biggest insult is the scan quality. This is where you really had to stand back and say, yes, this is truly an amateur job. Scans are not color adjusted, scanner artifacts are rife and they apparently decided not to scan high and then downsample. As a result the text is hard to read, and their stupid enhance text feature (to make up for the poor scanning job) doesn't help a whole lot.

My copy installed flawlessly onto my hard drive.  If you're wondering if this will work for you or not, here's what I think you need:

1)  A decent computer-- If your computer can be found on on an advertisement in National Geographic from the 80s or 90s, this software probably won't run too smoothly on your system.  So don't say that these CDs suck if your computer once survived Y2K.
2)  Follow the instructions --([...] )Their website tell you to insert disc 1, then go to preferences and update the software.  After doing that there is a button that says to install it to the hard drive.  It lets you choose where you want to install it, and after about 5-7 hours with vigilance to swap out the discs (real time depend on your computer), your software will be installed.  No tricks involved if you just update the software from the start.  Very easy.
3)  I expected there to be at least three things, but there's not.  It's quite simple.

I am overwhelmingly satisfied with this purchase.  I wish I could take a few days off just to catch up on some National Geographic reading, but instead I will enjoy the sparse moments with this software at random times over times over the next several years.  This would make for a great gift, a great resource, a great hobby if you had all day to read.

Negatives:  The only thing that would make this better in my opinion is if they could have some sort of side scroller that would show the different pages (smaller) so that you wouldn't have to clink each page one by one just to see what's on it.  Also, they need to solve the problem with the pages that need to be rotated 90 degrees to see the content.

The most important thing is the viewability of the scanned pages and this set does not disappoint. The original version left much to be desired, but these newly scanned images are bright and tack sharp. I appreciated that you could zoom in up to 2X and the text or photo stayed sharp. Indicative of high quality scans. The earlier set consisted of 30 CDs and you were constantly swapping them in and out. This new version has been condensed to 6 DVDs. Even better, you can copy the DVDs to your hard drive and cruise from 1888 to 2008 without touching a disc. Nice touches are the inclusion of a search feature and a very handy bookmarking tool. Another nice touch is the ability to print a single page or double page spread.
As other reviewers have pointed out, there is one flaw in an otherwise superb set. And that is the omission of a rotation feature. Many pictures were printed across the page and difficult to see.

1922,AEZDGIIKFNS8,1426296355,"This review is primarily about the software, not the content. I have updated the software to whatever was available as of this writing (3/29/2010). The software seems more like a beta version than a production-ready version. I've been kicked out a few times and it otherwise locks up periodically. I am running off the DVDs; I have not copied any of the disks to my hard drive. Consequently, moving from page to page is slow. Trying to back up to refer to a map or recall a fact is not something you want to do. Lock ups occur when trying to quickly scoot past several pages.

Even if paging were fast, there are other problems. I expect there to be a class action lawsuit against NG owing to the mass outbreak of carpal tunnel syndrome that is inevitable.  The text is unreadably small as presented, so I double-click twice ON EACH AND EVERY 2-PAGE sheet to magnify the text so I can read it. Then I must click and drag each page 2 or 3 times to move from top to bottom, and then a few more times to move to the top of the next column; the mouse scroll wheel is not active. A few book marks have thrown me to the magazine cover rather than to the desired page. As I progress through an issue, I have to create a new book mark at each stopping point as there is no quick way to reset an existing book mark.

If you are accustomed to an eReader like Kindle, the whole interface will seem like two steps backward. If this software is your first foray into reading significant amounts of magazine-like text on your computer, then you will think that a computer is not suitable for reading significant amounts of magazine-like text on your computer. For reference reading, the absence of any way to copy text from the page, or add notes to the text, makes this a poor reference tool.

My lone comment on the content stems from my attempt to begin reading from the very first issue. Basically, it seems that you'd better be a geologist or physiographer (term from text) to enjoy the early issues as even the first issue is thick with geo-jargon.

Pictures of faraway places, animals and people different from us stoked our imaginations while creating a sense of wonder that such things existed.  Originally sold only by subscription many homes treasured the magazines carefully preserving them in bookcases.  This set provides all the issues from 1888 to 2008, 120 years, in one small box.  Each issue is presented page by page, starting at the front cover and proceeding to the back cover.  All the maps are here too.  The set shows the world as it was and the process of changing into the world of today.  This is a living history lesson showing how America changes and adjusts into the modern world.
I am running this on a 64-bit VISTA system with no problems.  Print quality is excellent in even the 1888 issues.  A page magnifier is available but I have not found it necessary.  Photo quality varies over time.  The early issues have poor quality photographs because the printing process was not that great.  You can view all of the old photos but many are not that clear an image.  The interface is not intuitive but it is not impossible to use either.

But once you get the content in an external hard drive is lots of fun searching and viewing pages of the entire magazine collection.  Here are the proper instructions to put on an external hard drive as a fresh installation.

READ HERE - The EASY WAY to use the DVDs in an external hard drive configuration.  This works for both OS X Leopard and Windows 7 (should also work on Window XP but need to be tested).

Step 1 - Before any installation Copy the entire content of all the DVDs to the root (i.e. D:\) of the external drive.  You will end up with the installation programs, other files, and the six folder with the content (Disk1 to Disk6). Note:  copying them in a subdirectory instead that the bottom level (root level) does not work.

Step 2 - run the installation program from the external drive (this is key).

Step 3 - open the program and click ok when it asks to insert Disk 1.  The program will look for disk 1 on the drive that was installed from, the external drive, and will find all others automatically.

NOTE: If you had already install the program from the DVD before reading this uninstall the program using the uninstaller and manually delete the Data folder and all its content.

1926,ARS1U76WO9FJV,1426296355,"Good evening to all readers of National Geographic.
I rate this product the full five stars because it is the only collection of all 120 years of Nat Geo available on web or library. Lets be fair, to own this much pure access for only $60 is a five star deal!!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought mine at Best Buy for $59 and was told no returns on software, only an exchange. The many user comments are all true with reference to the lack of software sophistication. You need to have the necessary windows file knowledge to make the DVD's part of the hard drive at a generous 50GB of space. Several commenters refer to the Nat Geo FAQ page and this resource will give you the tools for a full integrated hard drive load.
My experience started with a twice crashed disk load. I had to uninstall it twice, change the update settings on the disk and the third time I was successful. To load the six DVD disks took over twelve hours with the last several disks taking the longest at several hours each. I have a 38"" LED monitor in tandem with three more 23"" monitors on my primary computer system. I do a great deal of computer and mathematics as a profession and will not simply give up on a software application because it is currently buggy. Do not give up either as this review states that the final product is worth five stars and Adobe Air will fix or improve all current software needs with a few more releases.
Having used the product extensively, it will stop responding in short time if you click on too many requests for page info without giving it time to load and move forward to the next request. I have a dual quad core system and it is the software as opposed to the hardware that is requiring Adobe to create a larger cache memory ratio for user throughput of info per page. It is pleasure to read the articles and use the google gadgets translator, currency converter and of course wikipedia to make sense out of the depth of content that is the hallmark of Nat Geo.
Improvements would be a non sophisticated and bullet proof loading of disks to hard drive, a right click fuctionality to Explorer accelerators and an efficent transfer to Microsoft OneNote for those who want to write reports and summaries of a search. I hope Adobe will incorporate these requests in the future and I will continue to check for the updates in the product start screen. I recommend the larger over 30"" screen for viewing the wide pages. I have not experienced a sideways picture yet and this may be a simple solution. Large monitors are not expensive and the double magnify and Lupe feature give deep detail to many of the pictures.

1929,A14I7UJ4C0J9IM,1426296355,"Pros: contains every page of every issue since the birth of this great magazine until 2009. Not just the texts, but photos, and even advertisements (granted that earlier issues from 1880's were free of photos).  It will take you a long time to read them all.  All for a reasonable price of ~$70

Cons:

1. The curse of software is that as soon as it comes out, it is obsolete.  And in the case of the CNG, regular updates only improves the software, but not the data because it ends in 2008.  It remains unknown if they will release incremental additional discs that start in 2009.  More often than not, companies release only the complete version that always starts from the beginning, frustrating early collectors.  But we won't know the answer until at lease a decade later, and by then, DVDs are probably no more useful than 8-tracks.

2. NGM is known for its awesome photos.  However, in the digital version, all pages are scanned with sub-par qualities.  When viewed at 100%, there are annoying artifacts around texts and the photos are posterized.  Also the resolution is too low, especially on these map inserts, small fonts are almost unintelligible.

3. Every page is a picture, making it impossible to copy and paste, and thus you will have to live with the compression artifacts, and are unable to do things like copying and pasting to a word processor to view it with real fonts.

4. The software framework is not every intuitive. It has a lot of features, but no documentation on how to use them. So all I do is browse by year/browse issues and read each issue from the first page to the last, just like I do a real magazine.

5. The software is poorly built. The software frequently screws up.  When you switch from one issue to another, it frequently fails to load the new one and shows a blank screen.  You will have to restart the software.

So it could've been done better, and I would be more than happy to pay double the price if they doubled the resolution and the number of discs.

After I have received it, well, I'm still happy that I own it, but it has been somewhat disappointing.

Instead of rambling, I'll just write it in bullet form, disappointments first:
1. As of Dec. 19, 2009, no HDD install
It's quite slow, and having it read from the DVD compounds this.  The only way around it is to copy them on your user-specific folder, which means that if you use a computer with more than one account, you'll need 50GBs of space per user if you want all of them to access it from the HDD.  The more tedious solution is to copy all the images on your harddrive and use a virtual DVD to load all the discs, but that is still awkward.

2. Slow
I can understand if the images are slow to load, or if the queries are slow due to the vast data, but I just don't understand why the geographic browser is slow on a computer that has more than one CPU.

3. Picture quality
I understand the reasoning behind loading not-so-great pictures in order to prevent some from using them outright, but the quality is hideous to somebody who enjoys photography.  It's nothing like something you'd expect in this decade - you can see jagged edges, jumps in tone, and everything else that screams that quality has been compromised for storage.  I would've been perfectly happy with pictures that they put on the web, resized so that it won't be usable outside of the computer, but the pics look as if they were scanned 10 years ago.

Well, that's about it for disappointments, but #1 is a big big big disappointment since it's advertised as if it can be loaded to your HDD, and NG isn't the same if it doesn't have absolutely stunning pictures.

As for the often mentioned type size in articles, if you have a 24-inch monitor, it's not a problem at all.  On my 24 inch LCD, the articles are slightly larger than lifesize when viewed full screen, and it's perfectly readable without any magnification.  Pictures, on the other hand, are awkward - let's just say that the bonus DVD has better still shots than the scanned pictures inside.

Still, it's nice to have 120 years worth of NG at your grasp, complete with ads and pictures, and able to search it for articles or even pictures, if you can remember at least part of its caption.",Softwares,2009-12-21,4,positive,must say excitement upon seeing pricetag wife didnt even bother arguing told must get received well im still happy but somewhat disappointing instead rambling ill write bullet form disappointments first dec no hdd install quite slow read dvd compounds way around copy userspecific folder means computer one account youll need 50gbs space per user want access hdd tedious solution copy images harddrive virtual dvd load discs but still awkward slow understand images slow load queries slow due vast data but dont understand geographic browser slow computer one cpu picture quality understand reasoning behind loading notsogreat pictures order prevent using outright but quality hideous somebody enjoys photography nothing something youd expect decade see jagged edges jumps tone everything else screams quality compromised storage wouldve perfectly happy pictures put web resized wont usable outside computer but pics look scanned years ago well thats disappointments but big big big disappointment since advertised loaded hdd ng isnt doesnt absolutely stunning pictures often mentioned type size articles inch monitor not problem inch lcd articles slightly larger lifesize viewed full screen perfectly readable without magnification pictures hand awkward lets say bonus dvd better still shots scanned pictures inside still nice years worth ng grasp complete ads pictures able search articles even pictures remember least part caption,-0.0008064516129031997,negative,14.0,positive,positive

You can see all the maps which were edited previouly in another software sold separately.

From today, this technical problem has been solved : NGS has sent us an Adobe Air update and now we have no more blank pages on the preview of the printing software machine. And really it works on paper.

With this update, you can also now rotate the old pages of the magazine like on a PDF software, which was not possible when the product was released.

Thanks NGS for these technical improvements, even if it took one year of complaint before they were achieved !

Now everybody can buy the CNG safely for reading and printing.

I saw that it was available in a set on DVD ROM so I bought it hoping it would be an adequate replacement. While all the content is there, the Adobe Air interface is terrible and is an exercise in frustration to attempt to navigate it. The default page size is too small for me to read the text, so I have to magnify it, but every time you turn the page it resets and you have to magnify it again.

After turning a few pages the program becomes non responsive and it just hourglasses for half a minute until it finally displays the next page. I tried it on my Macintosh as well and had the same results. Thinking it might be slow disk access causing the issue, I used the Mac's built in Disk Utility to create an .iso of one of the disks on my hard drive and mounted it as another drive. I still had the same slow and non-responsive behavior when it was running as a disk image on the hard drive as it did using the physical disk on both my PC and Mac.

1954,ARADXCOUVBS09,1426296355,"As of December 2009 there are definitely ways to copy the DVDs to a hard drive so that the DVDs are not required to use the program.

If you install the software and use the update option in Preferences to install the latest update then you get an option to specify where the DVD data is stored, and you just need to copy the contents of the disk1-6 folders from each disk to that location. Note that this copy process is rather slow (if you have more than one DVD drive you can do more than one copy at the same time) and the data are stored in inividual image files for each page so it has to copy around 34,000 files per disk. Each file copy seems to cause the DVD drive to seek back and forth across the disk once, which means 34,000 seeks per disk which slows the process significantly (to over an hour per disk) and also might result in a significant amount of wear and tear on the DVD drive (this is speculation).

Note that you'll need 50GB of available disk space if you choose to install all the data to disk!

The developers are actively updating the program and the latest Mac version has a ""copy everything to disk"" feature which does the work for you, and the Windows version should have this same function enabled literally any day now. The web site to follow for the latest info is COMPLETENATGEO.

This version of the Complete National Geographic is *much* improved over the one from several years ago. The viewing application is a much nicer application, it scales the images to the size of the application window nicely, and the full two-page spread images are quite readable on a 24"" 1920x1200 monitor.

Our local Costco has had a huge pile of these this holiday season, so I hope this review helps out some of the new purchasers looking for information about the product. If you haven't bought it yet, it's a great deal and an amazing wealth of information and imagery. Issues through (most of?) 2008 are included, and they say there will be an option in 2010 to buy the 2009 issues to add to your existing collection.

It can read, write, and format diskettes.  MEPIS linux can only read.  It could work with my PCI internal hardware controlled modem by manually configuring it to ttyS1.  At least it could do that logged in as root. Logged in as user, by default there is no permission to use the modem.  It takes command line instructions to give it permission to work.  I have not seen that before. SuSE 8.2 didn't do that. At least it's better than Ubuntu.  For all the gushing about Ubuntu, I have not seen anyone mention its total failure to work with a PCI modem.

1990,A2T2N8T5LGHL50,158298302X,"A long time unix fan, I found SuSE 10.1 to be a pleasant surprise. While the Novell Enterprise product, based on the SuSE 10.1 code base, is a bit more polished than SuSE 10.1, it's also more specialized, being divided into a desktop and a server edition. For my money, like SuSE 10.1 because it comes equipped with all the tools and features needed to serve either purpose quite nicely.

Linux has long been a power in the server room, with unusual flexibility, long uptimes and good performance, but linux vendors such as Novell are finally beginning to bring the power of the open source community to the desktop, and it shows. The added polish and attention to detail are making it conceivable for non-experts to begin using a linux desktop for their everyday routine.

As has been pointed out, there are some problems with this release - the biggest problem is the update mechanism, which I would describe as broken. Novell is committed to getting it working well, but in the meantime, I find that smart is an excellent replacement for yast. Smart is based on the ideas of the apt package tool, and capably fills the job of installing software packages and keeping the system up to date.

The other problem I see is the consumption of system resources by the beagle search engine. Again, I am sure this will be sorted out over time, but for now, I find that it's better to remove or disable beagle. Doing so completely removes any pauses or freezes on the systems I've tested, and enables a silky smooth game of ut2004 or quake 3 arena over the internet.

One other issue is the app-armor service, which while a good idea, is perhaps a bit restrictive. While it can be adjusted, some may find it easier to simply turn the service off.

With those 3 items addressed, SuSE 10.1 is a very capable, pleasant and snappy OS, and would rate 5 stars. The fact that the couple of issues I mentioned must be dealt to get to that blissful state, are the reason I rate it only 4 stars.

Bottom line: For an experienced linux user, a great OS for desktop and/or server room. For less experienced users, I'd recommend something without the minor nits I mentioned, e.g. Linspire, Xandros, or the Novell SLED 10 product instead.",Softwares,2006-09-09,4,positive,long time unix fan found suse pleasant surprise novell enterprise based suse code base bit polished suse also specialized divided desktop server edition money suse comes equipped tools features needed serve either purpose quite nicely linux long power server room unusual flexibility long uptimes good performance but linux vendors novell finally beginning bring power open source community desktop shows added polish attention detail making conceivable nonexperts begin using linux desktop everyday routine pointed problems release biggest problem update mechanism would describe broken novell committed getting working well but meantime find smart excellent replacement yast smart based ideas apt package tool capably fills job installing software packages keeping system date problem see consumption system resources beagle search engine sure sorted time but find better remove disable beagle completely removes pauses freezes systems ive tested enables silky smooth game ut2004 quake arena internet one issue apparmor service good idea perhaps bit restrictive adjusted may find easier simply turn service items addressed suse capable pleasant snappy os would rate stars fact couple issues mentioned must dealt get blissful state reason rate stars bottom line experienced linux user great os desktop andor server room less experienced users id recommend something without minor nits mentioned eg linspire xandros novell sled instead,0.24776785714285715,positive,26.0,positive,positive

2016,A1GXDAHJBN3C5T,1597750328,"UPDATE 1/1/08: I just got a Mac after always previously using Windows.  Great news--when I installed this 4.0 software, not only did it work fine, but it also corrected the two most serious objections I previously had with it.  I now have no problems importing waypoints from my Garmin GPSmap 60CSx, and the software is now compatible with all the states I own from the previous Version 3 software.  I don't know whether this is unique to Mac or whether it now works just as well with Windows, but when I did the installation, it automatically went to the National Geographic web site and downloaded a software update.  I still give it 4 stars because of some of the other non-standard user interface choices, but these are easy enough to get used to.  I didn't change the rest of the review, so keep this update in mind as you read it.

National Geographic topo maps are great if your understand their strengths and limitations (I have the Nevada version but they all work the same). First, don't expect to import the actual maps into a GPS receiver. These maps are raster-scanned directly from USGS 7.5' topos; GPS receivers use vector-graphic maps that are only available from your receiver's manufacturer (and they are much less detailed than NG maps). But you should never expect your GPS receiver's display to completely replace a paper map anyway. It's too small to show much detail, and if your receiver fails, you'd be out of luck. NOTE: Magellan has just introduced the Triton series, which is the first product designed to import maps from Topo!.  This is a great advancement, but I haven't yet evaluated it to see how well it works.

Since these are based on USGS maps, they have the same high quality including tons of detail, but since many USGS maps are more than 10 years old, you won't necessarily get up-to-date information. Since topographic features don't ordinarily change as frequently as man-made features, you're usually OK, but keep this in mind.

These maps allow you do a lot of other things with your GPS. You can create waypoints on the computer, either by placing a marker on the map or by entering in the latitudes and longitudes of your points, then transferring them to the GPS. This is much easier than manually entering the info through your GPS user interface. You can also download tracks from your GPS receiver onto the map to see where you've been. And you can draw intended journeys directly on the map screen, then measure the distance and elevation profile of the route. The elevation profile is a bit noisy, but you get a pretty good idea of how much elevation change you'll experience on a hike. The tool you use to draw the route on the screen could benefit from an improved user interface, but with a little practice you can get pretty good at it. If you make a mistake, hold down the right mouse button to erase the error. One thing I like is that you can print out a custom paper map, and if you print using your inkjet on NG's waterproof paper, you can get a custom color map that really is waterproof. This latest edition is designed to work with USB receivers like the Garmin GPSMap 60-series. This is a tremendous advantage compared to the previous edition.  BUT please note that it isn't completely compatible with the new GPSMap60CSx.  It doesn't import waypoint names properly, they end up being simple numbers starting at 001.  For some reason this isn't a problem with the older GPSMap60Cs.

  The main objection I have is that it isn't easily compatible with the previous edition. In my case, I had the prior edition for California, and expected the California CDs to work with the new software. But for some reason they don't. So I have to leave the old edition installed for the California maps and the new one for Nevada maps. Fortunately I can use the USB capability of the Nevada software to download the California waypoints and tracks from my 60CSx. I then have to save the .tpo file, launch the old edition software and pull up the California map, then import the .tpo file. Very inconvenient, but at least there is a way to make it work. I guess they would prefer I buy a new edition of the California maps.

  The only other thing to note is that they still haven't completely adopted Windows user interface conventions. For example, there are no scroll bars on the side and bottom of the map to allow you to move the map on your screen. You have to move your cursor to the edge of the map, watch for the cursor to change to an arrow, and hold down the mouse button. The direction of scroll depends on exactly where on the screen your cursor is. Another observation is that there is no EDIT menu, so I can't easily cut and paste data into other applications.

The problem comes when you realize that the underlying USGS quadrangles are often badly out of date with man-made things, such as trails and park boundaries.  There is no support for updating the maps in the style of the original.  Still, you can make passable updates -- just invent your own conventions.

You can merge in someone else's updates -- the problem comes if you then get a revised version of those updates.  There is no supported way to do the second merge (i.e. replace the first merge with the newer one), or to back out the first merge (i.e. to remove what the first merge put in without also removing any updates you yourself may have added) so that the newer merge can go cleanly.

Overall a decent product.  Plain vanilla out-of-the-box stuff works fine.  Trying to upgrade the maps to be truly useful for your area can be pretty frustrating, though.

2027,AN3MCDVQO66A9,1597750328,"I have been using Topo! since it was a Wildflower product back in the early 1990's. The interface does take some getting used to as mentioned before, but like all powerful software programs (vi/emacs) eventually, it becomes second nature.

I mostly use TOPO! to annotate my previous trips, plan future trips, share travel guides with family, and create georeferenced raster maps for handheld GPS devices.

My trips primarily used to be hiking and backpacking trips, which I would dutifully record using an old Garmin Etrex GPS receiver. The tracks and waypoints would be uploaded to the desktop and saved as separate .tpo files. Back in the day, I was plenty happy just to see waypoint times and elevation gains as documentation of my backcountry trips. I would also use TOPO to create waypoint routes (up to 30) to be uploaded to the GPS receiver so that I could plan/program my future hikes into the Etrex.

Since those early primitive days, both TOPO! and I have changed a lot! TOPO! has improved significantly in its featurea. Now that I have two kids and more money, my outdoor travels consist mostly of Jeeping, dry car camping, and ancient rock art hunting.

Now, with the newer versions of TOPO, it is possible to add pictures and notes. In turn, these more detailed maps can be useful as travelogues not only for nostalgia, but also as travel guides for family members and friends who are using TOPO! as well.

While similar functionality could be obtained by using Google Earth or Maps, this map sharing is dependent on ""cloud computing"". This may be feasible when sitting in a coffee shop in a metropolis or even at home, but out in the desert without cellphone access this is not a viable option. Further, Google Map data is only protected by obscurity. Any person who knows the URL to your map data can view it.

Since I don't have to carry gear on my back anymore, I primarily use TOPO in the field on a laptop with an external GPS receiver. Though bulky, it is a much more useful combination than simply a tiny handheld receiver alone due to the larger size of the laptop screen and the ability to search for waypoints using the standard keyboard. My family uses a similar setup and they too find it reassuring to know that they have a clearly mapped GPS route available to them in the wild.

Finally, the most useful aspect of TOPO! is unfortunately no longer available, unless you can beg, borrow, or steal a boxed Xport Pro package. NatGeoMaps recently and quite quietly killed off its entire TopoPro line (including for ArcGIS). Xport Pro (formerly $199) allows the user to export high quality USGS maps in the georeferenced GeoTiff format. These GeoTiffs could then be used in shareware GPS programs like OziExplorer for Windows computers or OziWince or NoniGPSplot for WinCE GPS devices (many personal navigation devices can be cracked to run these apps in addition to the installed street mapping software). It used to be that you could call in a credit card number to NatGeoMaps customer service and for $99 get the functionality activated through a PIN, but no longer :( .

2028,A1GXDAHJBN3C5T,1597750301,"UPDATE 1/1/08: I just got a Mac after always previously using Windows.  Great news--when I installed this 4.0 software, not only did it work fine, but it also corrected the two most serious objections I previously had with it.  I now have no problems importing waypoints from my Garmin GPSmap 60CSx, and the software is now compatible with all the states I own from the previous Version 3 software.  I don't know whether this is unique to Mac or whether it now works just as well with Windows, but when I did the installation, it automatically went to the National Geographic web site and downloaded a software update.  I still give it 4 stars because of some of the other non-standard user interface choices, but these are easy enough to get used to.  I didn't change the rest of the review, so keep this update in mind as you read it.

National Geographic topo maps are great if your understand their strengths and limitations (I have the Nevada version but they all work the same). First, don't expect to import the actual maps into a GPS receiver. These maps are raster-scanned directly from USGS 7.5' topos; GPS receivers use vector-graphic maps that are only available from your receiver's manufacturer (and they are much less detailed than NG maps). But you should never expect your GPS receiver's display to completely replace a paper map anyway. It's too small to show much detail, and if your receiver fails, you'd be out of luck. NOTE: Magellan has just introduced the Triton series, which is the first product designed to import maps from Topo!.  This is a great advancement, but I haven't yet evaluated it to see how well it works.

Since these are based on USGS maps, they have the same high quality including tons of detail, but since many USGS maps are more than 10 years old, you won't necessarily get up-to-date information. Since topographic features don't ordinarily change as frequently as man-made features, you're usually OK, but keep this in mind.

These maps allow you do a lot of other things with your GPS. You can create waypoints on the computer, either by placing a marker on the map or by entering in the latitudes and longitudes of your points, then transferring them to the GPS. This is much easier than manually entering the info through your GPS user interface. You can also download tracks from your GPS receiver onto the map to see where you've been. And you can draw intended journeys directly on the map screen, then measure the distance and elevation profile of the route. The elevation profile is a bit noisy, but you get a pretty good idea of how much elevation change you'll experience on a hike. The tool you use to draw the route on the screen could benefit from an improved user interface, but with a little practice you can get pretty good at it. If you make a mistake, hold down the right mouse button to erase the error. One thing I like is that you can print out a custom paper map, and if you print using your inkjet on NG's waterproof paper, you can get a custom color map that really is waterproof. This latest edition is designed to work with USB receivers like the Garmin GPSMap 60-series. This is a tremendous advantage compared to the previous edition.  BUT please note that it isn't completely compatible with the new GPSMap60CSx.  It doesn't import waypoint names properly, they end up being simple numbers starting at 001.  For some reason this isn't a problem with the older GPSMap60Cs.

  The main objection I have is that it isn't easily compatible with the previous edition. In my case, I had the prior edition for California, and expected the California CDs to work with the new software. But for some reason they don't. So I have to leave the old edition installed for the California maps and the new one for Nevada maps. Fortunately I can use the USB capability of the Nevada software to download the California waypoints and tracks from my 60CSx. I then have to save the .tpo file, launch the old edition software and pull up the California map, then import the .tpo file. Very inconvenient, but at least there is a way to make it work.

2060,A3N38QB5HHOGV1,1600775411,"The software provides a nice start if you want to learn spanish, but it does not deliver a complete course up to a certain level. The set up is that you start talking about business and technology pretty quick, without having received any grammar and practice that comes with that. You learn words and basis phrases first, but only in the present tense. Past tenses or other tenses are not being explained, which is in my opinion more important than talking business (if I would go and talk business in spanish, I would like to know how to make proper phrases in general, before I can actually worry about business talk).
The word practice and the games are really good and very easy to use. It is also sort of ""fun"" so it does motivate a lot to do it.
The phrases however are a bit slow and a bit confusing, the words are first spoken in English and even I who does not speak any spanish (yet) can notice that the translations are not very accurate (which is in my opinion a very important thing in a language course). Since they don't explain anything else, about the grammar, it is a bit confusing when the phrases are not very correct. For example, the English voice says; What soup do you have? The spanish translation to that is: ""Tiene sopa?"" which I think means: Do you have soup? and has nothing to do with what kind of soup they have......After that the answer is followed, but only in Spanish and is not translated in the help language. There is a picture in the screen however, with some sort of vegetable soup, but the answer is ""Hoy tenemos sopa de ajo casera"" which I think is quite complicated to figure out that their answer is that they have soup (from the house or home made) with garlic!
This course is nice to learn vocabulary and to have on the side, but you do need a proper book or classes to get into the real conversational spanish, because just with this, it is not possible to learn all of that.

After doing my homework, I finally decided to invest in this product.

Many people complain about the teaching method of this software but I think the problem is that many people are comparing this economically priced software with foreign language learning software that costs several hundred dollars.  If the price of this software were several hundred dollars, I would have probably only given it 1 star. But this software does not cost several hundred dollars and happens to be one of the most economically priced software programs available for learning a foreign language. At the very least, this software will teach you how to say and recognize a few hundred words. For that reason, I must give this software at least 4 stars.

Without a doubt, what I like most about this program is that it has lots of Spanish lessons at a very good price. The first level consists of 2 CDs that cover a lot of basic words and phrases that are helpful to know. And the second level also has 2 CDs that build on the words and phrases covered in Level 1 by giving the learner the tools to put together increasingly more complex sentences while ensuring that you are also learning proper pronunciation.  I found that the second level taught enough so that at the completion of the second level, the student should be able to string together basic phrase or sentences in order to converse about members of the family, sports, etc.

The third level which consisted of two CDs as well was my favorite level because it was the most challenging which is ideal for me because  I have been studying Spanish for quite a while. The actual conversations in the third level were a lot more challenging for me than the single vocabulary words covered in level 1 and the basic phrases covered in level 2. The third level also helped to reinforce what I learned in the other lessons.

There is a bonus CD with a game that comes with Immersion Spanish called Oscar On The Lake which I did not find fun at all.  I could have easily done without the Oscar On The Lake game. In fact, I don't see what was the point in including this Oscar On The Lake game with the program.

But I did find that the audio CD was very helpful. The audio CD thoroughly covered the alphabet, greetings, pronouns (including vosotros) conjugating AR, ER, and IR verbs, weather, numbers, and vocabulary for shopping and at the post office. What I liked most about the audio CD is that the instructor gave a lot grammatical explanations  including when the ""vos"" (as opposed to ""vosotros"") is used instead of the ""tu"" form.
One of the bonuses that I received with my Immersion Spanish software was in interactive DVD with Spanish learning games for the whole family. The DVD is can be used on the TV.  But I haven't had a chance to use the DVD because the 3 Levels consisting of 6 CDs and the audio CD, have enough to keep me busy for a quite a while.  One feature about Immersion Spanish the appeals to me is that the software can be used by both children and adults who want to learn Spanish.  Based on the product's price and the content, I recommend it.

Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Visual Link Spanish. This is a great  learning Spanish software program for the visual learner. Before I discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Visual-Link-Spanish-Level-I/dp/B0000C08KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Visual Link Spanish - Level I</a>, in all of my reviews I used to recommend Rosetta software. But after using Visual Link, it is clear to me that this software is a much better alternative for the visual learner. If you do not consider  yourself a visual learner, then&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fluenz-Version-F2-Spanish-1-2-3-4-5-with-supplemental-Audio-CDs-and-Podcasts/dp/B002ZF31NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fluenz Version F2: Spanish 1+2+3+4+5 with supplemental Audio CDs and Podcasts</a>&nbsp;is probably the way to go.

To speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verbarrator-Version-1-1-Windows-Version/dp/B002EADP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)</a>&nbsp;software. The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I use almost daily.

The last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Spanish-Review-and-Practice-w-CD-ROM-UItimate-Review-Reference-Series/dp/0071492151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series)</a>.

2071,A2YI8MRQ1HKFPA,1600775411,"I purchased this item six weeks ago in hopes of refreshing my basic understanding of spanish, which I hadnt used in any form in years. While I won't go so far as to say this item is a complete failure, I will say that it is definitely lacking. The simplest analogy I can think of is this software goes from step one to step three, and leaves you wondering what was supposed to be in the middle. I have tested each cd, some as high as a dozen times, and feel no strong connection to the software. I find that the nouns, verbs, and sayings that I had previously learned are sticking, but most of whats new is failing to make an impression. I even write each word on an index card, along with the phonetic spelling, and then review the word later to make more of a connection. Without taking those extra few steps, I feel like I would have learned 10% as much as I have, which hasn't been much. The review games are hacky,and most of the visuals are crude cartoon drawings. Furthermore, one male and one female greet you on some of the lesson screens in an attempt to simulate someone talking. In reality, there's a two second loop that plays for each person, and it skips then repeats over and over as long as the lesson is going. It doesnt sound like much, and Im having a hard time accurately describing the presentation, but trust me, its annoying. All in all, the product isn't terrible, but I don't expect to fully absorb more than a few hundred words due solely to this software.

2081,A2EF64HUKVH6IU,1600775411,"This product was a waste of money. The primary problem with it was that it is not a coherent product--it is a poorly repackaged mishmash of other products. My wife purchased this (not on Amazon) to try to improve her vocabulary which had gotten rusty. She found that the first disc was mostly okay, but several other discs were outdated programs designed for children, or wouldn't even run at all without installing other software such as the execrable QuickTime. She found that there was no apparent transition from the beginner disc to a much more advanced disc. If there was an intermediate disc, it was one of the ones that wouldn't run.

The best portions of the software come from a company called Eurotalk. This means the dialect of Spanish being taught is not American Spanish, but European Spanish, which is much less useful unless you happen to be planning a trip to Europe. This seriously reduces its usefulness to Americans looking to improve their Spanish skills for the sake of improving their marketability for a job, for instance. The fact that this was European Spanish was not mentioned on the packaging, so we were misled. And the Eurotalk segments are not all in the same series, so some are for kids and some are not.

Worst of all, the money-back guarantee offered by the makers of the product is a complete sham. To get your money back you have to ship them the software, for which they recommend you purchase insurance and use a trackable method, and include a letter asking for a refund, then wait 6-8 weeks for your refund. If you don't get it, you have only an address to write to to ask where your money is or you can e-mail them. Oh, and they don't refund your shipping or your sales tax. Cute.

What's the difference between them and Rosetta Stone? They claim the difference is only about $500, but at least Rosetta Stone is selling a complete product. For those who are looking for an immersive form of Spanish learning that is less expensive and slightly less immersive (i.e. will give you a little English to work with) than Rosetta Stone, don't expect to get much out of this product.

Instant Immersion is a great starting place to introduce foreign language to children: 1. It's interactive, engaging and entertaining. 2. It's a less-expensive alternative than other programs.

This is better than a textbook or from a class. 1. Correct pronunciation is at your fingertips. You just can't get that from reading. 2. Associate visual and audio cues to aid in learning. 3. I don't have to worry about the smart kids dictating the pace of the class.

Based on a recent study, it was determined that repetitive testing (practice exams) help us develop cues to learning foreign words. For example, windu is Swahili for clouds. It's easy to associate ""wind"" with clouds. The reason I mention this is that these software programs can significantly aid our brains in developing multiple associations. We see the pictures, we hear the speaker and we determine the rate of our learning progress.

The negative: Discipline. It's tough to sit down and dedicate the time needed to learn the language unless this is made part of an after-school assignment or maybe a homeschool learning objective.

The games look like they were made in the 80s, they also run slow because they are all coming from a CD Rom. The vocabulary is merely okay. They show you the item and you're supposed to pick what it is. Honestly, it's not that difficult to mess that up. I was very disappointed in the voice/microphone aspect of it. With instant immersion you speak into the microphone, but the program doesn't grade/rate how well you did it. It just records it, so you can listen to yourself again. What good is that? In Rosetta Stone, the program actually determines how well you said it and gives you a rating, this really helped me improve my accent. Also for vocabulary, you can get an even better program and it's FREE. Go to SpanishDict com and their flashcard games are great. They even have video lectures, which are also free. Back to Instant Immersion, the grammar portion seemed okay, it involved you putting random phrases in the correct order. For people with a decent amount of Spanish, this program is also too basic, which I should've been tipped off on by Level 1,2,3.

2107,A2NUBL2UYWPBWR,1600775411,"An inexpensive ""try me"" alternative to the Rosetta Stone.

The Instant Immersion language series is based on the same learning principle as the Rosetta Stone:  Natural Learning.  It is based on the theory that we learn a language by repetition and continuous exposure to a language or environment.  Theoretically this is true.  However, each person learns in a different combination of ways based on his/her previous experiences and therefore the way in which we learn develops as we age.  How effective any program is, boils down to whether the method of teaching matches that individual's method of learning.

This product contains a number of CD s for listening to role-play conversations and role-play games in Spanish on a specific subject, say buying a T-Shirt.  In this script you will be exposed to words for size, colors, numbers and basic phrase such as ""I would like___"", ""Could you please give me___""

This product also contains a DVD which is essentially a number of photo-flashcards for word association.  This is only slightly more helpful than the CD s because you can see a video of a man and a woman taking turns speaking the language and you can mimic the way their mouths move in order to refine your pronunciation.

In comparison to the Rosetta Stone this product is not as in-depth, comprehensive or as organized.  It is basically a  ""light"" ""try me"" mini version of the Rosetta Stone.  At this price, it is a good introductory program for both the learning method as well as Spanish vocabulary.  It does not contain as much grammar or sentence building knowledge as the Rosetta Stone series or the Pimsleur series.  It resembles a phrasebook set to CD.

As both a Pro and a Con of this type of product: expect the Spanish version to be similar to the Italian version, the French version, the Japanese version etc.  Works well if you thrive with this learning method but is bad for those that are  bored easily.

Recommended if
1) You always wanted to try the Rosetta Stone style of learning but are not sure you want to spend that much $ yet.

2114,A1W5N8OT55A9Y3,1600775411,"I have taken Spanish classes off and on over the years, but this is the first computer DVD set that I have tried (Many years ago I tried the Pimsler audio cassette series for French and really liked them).  I am pretty conversant in Spanish, having learned it mostly just from working with and around Spanish-speaking people over the years.  I found this computer-aided method of learning to not work particularly well for me.  Even though I spend most of my time during work hours in front of the computer (or perhaps because of it), I found it hard to be engaged by this program.

Some overall thoughts:

I personally found the user interface to be pretty clunky.  It has a distinct ""Fischer Price"" feel to it with lots of blocky pictures and primary colors.  I found the awkwardly animated ""talking heads"" to be more of a distraction and annoyance than a useful tool for learning pronunciation.

I found it hard to understand what ""lesson"" I should be following.  There does not seem to be a directly prescriptive path that the program wants you to follow, so you tend to spend a lot of time poking around and exploring, which might be entertaining, but doesn't lead to a cohesive and structured learning process.  This is what I've always liked about audio CDs or cassette tapes - they are numbered, and you listen to them in sequence (usually accompanied by a workbook).  You *can* skip ahead if you like, but you always know where you left off and jumped ahead, making it easy to go back if you want.  Using this program, I really felt ""lost"" a lot of the time.

My 13-year old daughter is taking Spanish in school and LOVES it, yet I could not get her interested in this program at all.  I think she had the same problem I did - sitting in front of the computer just doesn't seem conducive to being able to focus on and learn a language.

Bottom line, I think this product is adequate for ""refreshing"" yourself if your high school or college Spanish is a bit rusty, but I don't think it is designed in a way to be well-suited for learning the language from scratch.

The largest problem I am having the the Instant Immersion series (in general) is they don't seem to update anything. I've used the Japanese version in the past, and got ahold of this Spanish version. The graphics are dated and unattractive. The videos/animation slow and not fluid. This looks like they took the same product they've been peddling for years and updated the installation programs and little else which is unfortunate. I understand a product like this wants to be low profile so it can install on even the oldest computers still running (and many of those old computers are still more than enough for average users), but I just find this method cheap and unappealing. That sounds are still hollow sounding as well and modern day clip-art looks more attractive. The games/learning tools are the same but not expanded. It doesn't look like they added new words or addressed much new material at all.

I still think these are interesting to start with if you don't have an old version. If you do have an old version and can get it to function properly on your current build, pass on these. There just isn't enough new here to justify buying it again.",Softwares,2010-02-17,3,positive,understand tendency continue producing company thinks work learning new language brushing existing skill tricky business learned lot japanese learning japan but not always possible go country cement start language skills picked spanish version largest problem instant immersion series general dont seem update anything ive japanese version past got ahold spanish version graphics dated unattractive videosanimation slow not fluid looks took theyve peddling years updated installation programs little else unfortunate understand wants low profile install even oldest computers still running many old computers still enough average users but find method cheap unappealing sounds still hollow sounding well modern day clipart looks attractive gameslearning tools but not expanded doesnt look added new words addressed much new material still think interesting start dont old version old version get function properly current build pass isnt enough new justify buying,0.050248579545454544,negative,-1.0,negative,negative

2120,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,1600775411,"I have used ""Instant Immersion Spanish Levels 1,2 & 3"" for several months now and it is a complete Spanish language program that can teach basic words and conversational Spanish, but it does require a significant commitment to be made by the user. You get a lot with this set but the quality of the content varies greatly from disc to disc. The program includes, in recommended order of use:

1) An MP3 Audio CD - This teaches the basic vocabulary and phrases. It can also be downloaded onto an iPod.

The main learning programs follow and need to be installed to run. These include lessons, games, and allow for downloading elements to an iPod -
2) Level 1, Disc 1 (Talk Now) CD-ROM
3) Level 1, Disc 2 (Vocabulary Builder) CD-ROM
4) Level 2, Disc 1 (Talk More) CD-ROM
5) Level 2, Disc 2 (Talk the Talk) CD-ROM
6) Level 3, Disc 1 (World Talk) CD-ROM
7) Level 3, Disc 2 (Business Talk) CD-ROM

8) ""Talk More"" Interactive DVD - This is basically an overview that includes basic phrases and quizzes, but is hard to navigate
9) ""Who is Oscar Lake"" CD-ROM Game - This is an actual PC game that plays like one of the popular mystery games (i.e. Nancy Drew, etc)

The Audio CD and PC Game feel like they were added as extras since they don't really match the rest of the class.

I deducted rating stars because of the clumsy feel of the games, the user recording without verification (something other programs support), and lack of a cohesive lesson plan.

I had two years of Spanish in High School (almost 30 years ago), so this program was a much needed refresher. In addition, my daughter has just finished her 3rd year of High School Spanish and she went through some of the program (and game play) with me. We both agree that while this program (and likely those similar to it) will teach you the basic words and phrases, nothing will let you develop and retain a second language unless you actually use it with native speakers on a regular basis.

This program does give you a lot for the price so it is a good value but as another reviewer points out, learning another language is harder as you get older! Start early and good luck!

2125,A3QI0H38D5E1RK,1600775411,"I've taken a total of four semesters of Spanish divided up between High School and College, but after going three years without speaking Spanish, I needed to find a program to help me review before taking Fourth Semester Spanish at the senior college level.

I was disappointed in the overall structure of the software. I thought I would learn more with each disk, and the phrases that are emphasized are more geared towards individuals who need to know Spanish on vacation or while studying abroad. The first two levels provide good vocabulary practice, but do not challenge the student to construct sentences. There are important Spanish basics, such as verb conjugation, that should be a major lesson in the first two levels. I felt like I was spending a bunch of time reviewing simple Spanish words, rather than learning to construct sentences. The creator of the software made some practice games to help the learning process, but for my level I've found the games are a bit too simple, even when I did not remember most of the vocabulary that was taught before the lessons. A lot of what I learned from the software is something that I can figure out by picking up a Spanish-English dictionary. I needed more practice dealing with verbs, sentence structure, expressing feelings, and more in-depth practice with telling time.

I hate to be so critical of the software, because it can be interactive (the games) and there is some variety between the disks. It is also colorful- graphics, sound, etc. is pretty solid. However, for the price the software is originally marked at, I would invest in a e-book or even find some credible online tutorials if you are a student or someone hoping to learn Spanish for scholarly purposes. If you want to learn some basics, and practice in an interactive way to prepare for a vacation, a business trip or studying abroad, then this may be a good refresher in some important Spanish phrases you should know.
In conclusion, the usefulness of this software depends on what you are looking for. Are you a student who needs to eventually become fluent and construct your own phrases? Or are you simply looking to learn the basic, everyday phrases? Your answer to this question will determine if you will find use in this program.

2128,A2KO5LOXOKCT88,1600775411,"There are some things I like about this total package but when it is all added up it is a confusing mess that if used by itself could have you spending a lot of time memorizing specific phrases and hoping that the native speaker you're conversing with know the specific response that you've memorized already to understand. I've wrote an essay which probably noone will read so for those who just need some concise points:

What I like:
-The Level 3, Disc 1 (more below)
-The included Audio CD
-The price at $20 is reasonable

What I don't like:
-The lack of coheshion between the different CDs
-The absurd claims on the box
-The absence of grammar/sentence structures/verb conjugations in the computer program
-The use of 9 CDs/DVDs to market the program when it could all be contained on 2, possibly one disc.

This is what you can expect to find on the different discs included, inclding their pluses and negatives.

Level 1, Disc 1
This disc will teach you the basics of Spanish vocabulary, you'll learn some basic colors, numbers, body parts, food.  It is the 2nd strongest CD in the set, don't expect to be wowed by the graphics, games, or highly research-validated advanced language immersive techniques.  It's at a technological level of probably around 20 years ago and honestly was probably developed 20 years ago but has received a few ""real-life"" actors to make it seem polished, but after watching (and laughing) at the same over-exagerrated ""Si"" for correct answers I switched to the low-tech computer cartoon characters.  The easy games are painfully easy, and the other games help you learn the vocabulary but all are basically the same game with different vocabulary words, so you'll get bored if trying to cram too much in at one time.

Level 1, Disc 2
You'd expect this to be a continuation of what you learned in the first disc but you'd be wrong.  I think the person who decided what to put in the box saw this old language program laying around from 25 years ago and figured might as well throw another CD in.  It has some more vocabulary which you can record yourself saying and 3 games (really just one game style formatted a bit differently) that you can pick out the picture to the vocabulary word, one of the main reason I bought the set was to learn more vocabulary but there really isn't much interaction with the program to learn the words besides looking at the pictures and then memorizing the word.  And I'm not really sure who picked out the vocab words, I've never heard a Spanish person speaking about Igloos, so why would I want to learn it as a beginner?  And is professions we're given an orchesta director but not a firefighter or police officer.

Level 2, Disc 1
This disc will teach you some common phrases and the alphabet, phrases you'll use at the airport, restaurants, around town.  As a beginner you'll want to learn some of these phrases and you'll be picking up vocabulary as well.  Unfortunately this might be the most boring way to learn.  You can listen to the phrase in English or your language of choice and then hear it in Spanish, but it is much more exciting to repeat the phrase into a microphone as well and then you can hear yourself say it, I suppose perfecting your pronounciation by doing it over and over again, provided you can objectively hear what you may not be pronouncing right.  There are exciting multiple-choice quizes for most of the categories, but the 10 multiple choices questions are always the same (random order) so a category might have 20 phrases but you'll only be quized the same 10 questions over and over again.  What scares me the most about this CD (and also Level 2, Disc 2 & Level 3, Disc 2 - which are structured identially only different phrases/categories) is that you can memorize 200 phrases but will only be picking up grammar, sentence structure, and other Spanish syntax by chance.  For example, you'll learn how to ask ""How are you?"", ""Como estas?"" in Espanol but the background picture is of two men greeting in a very formal setting which would typically mean that ""Como esta?"" the more formal way of saying ""How are you?"" is appropriate, but no where on the CDs are you going to learn about Tu vs. Usted, sure you'll be understood but it's such a basic topic in Spanish (and without a direct equilivant in English) that I can't believe ""The COMPLETE Language Learning System"" doesn't have it clearly explained in some form.  The other concern is you'll be learning phrases that use verbs in the form of the present tense, subjunctive, conditional, future, imperfect, and perfect indicative, but again no where on the CDs does it cover verb tenses, or even verb conjugations.  So you might learn to say I want to go to the park, Quiero ir al parque, but after completing all the CD and memorize 600 phrases, not know how to say We want to go to the park, Queremos...PLEASE don't think that this program alone will get you to any level beyond beginning Spanish skills.

Level 2, Disc 2
This follows the exact same format as Disc 1, 200 more phrases and vocabulary, covering school, families, hobbies, computers, sports.  Reread Level 2, Disc 1 if you forgot what the pros and cons are for rote memorization.

Level 3, Disc 1
This is the CD I like, and honestly if they sold this alone for $10 and didn't claim you could reach all your language dreams and hopes, I'd give this 5 stars.  Again, this is a piece of software in this set like Level 1, Disc 2 that just seems to be thrown in, it is probably a good 20 years old as well but what I like about this is it is more immersive, you'll want some vocab lists to play the games but you're not going to find any, you'll click the help button and it'll give you more help in Spanish and you're like a lot good that'll do me but it does for example it might tell you a sentence in Spanish to pick the black dog, presuming you don't know the word for black or dog you click the help button and it show you a picture of a car that is black and says, here is a black car, you brain hears negro twice finds the only similarities between the black car and the other pictures to choose from is that one is black, negro=black, you click, you're right, happiness and your brain makes the connection, with repetition the connection come quicker, that is some good brain learning theory on this program. One of the games gives you directions in Spanish and then you have to find it on a map and again unlike the same multiple choice questions on the other CDs that get boring after the first time it is different each time so you can actually practice listening to directions in Spanish and figuring out where you need to go (a very valuable skill if you ever plan on using that ""Donde esta el/la..."" phrase).  There's also a little gameshow simulation that you can play against the computer or against a worthy opponent, again the multiple choice questions have enough variations that it doesn't get bored in like 10 seconds.  After finishing up the a few other things on the other discs this will be the only one that I'll come back to use.

Level 3, Disc 2
I which this were more like the first disc at this level but it regresses to the Level 2 format.  Yes we can record 200 more phrases and vocabulary, now covering business meetings, finance, and accounting!!  Woohoo!  If you buy it right off the website by itself it costs nearly $50!  So how lucky we are that we can now talk business.  Reread Level 2, Disc 1 if you forgot what the pros and cons are for rote memorization.

Then there are the other 3 other discs:
Talk More Ineractive DVD
This is Level 2, Disc 1 in a DVD format.  Instead of using your mouse you can use your remote control, but I guess you can't record yourself speaking, but you can play the exact same multiple choice quizes now with a time limit, if you could play all the lessons at once it would be great as a sleep-aide.

Who is Oscar Lake? Game
Admitedly, this is what intrigued me enough about this software program compared to the others.  Very few are going to finish this game because it won't appeal to the gamer or serious Spanish learner.  The gamer will get frustrated with it archaic design, the point to click to move to this area or enter this room is not engaging and probably just frustate those who don't play video games because it isn't very intuitive.  The serious Spanish learner will get bored with fixed conversations and the amount of clicking in between the conversations.  I played for about 2 hours and found the most entertaining part where I could turn on the TV and see a picture of a piece of luggage and hear a recorded ad to buy that luggage.  It'll be a bored day for me when I figure out who is Oscar Lake.

The Audio CD
If you remember the beginning you'll recall this is something that I like.  The audio CD has no direct tie-in with anything else, another stand-alone product that got lumped into the complete set.  The audio CD is the only place you'll find grammar, verbs, pronounciation, even instructions on accent marks.  This by itself would also get 4 or 5 stars, I'm guessing the workbook that they also have for sale probably parrells the audio CD.  I wish the software designed used the audio CD as their model because a lot of it could benefit an interactive visual context.  I wish it was designed so that it could just pop into the average CD player, I don't think I'm going to go thru the effort to burn it onto a special CD so I can listen to it in the car.  I doubt most people will ever get to the audio CD which is disappointing because it has the most depth if you really want to learn Spanish.

Conclusion:
I read the box and it says they've sold 2.2 million units at a price of $49.95, that is over 10 million dollars!  And considering a lot of the programing they reuse with just different languages there is some serious dinero to be had in foreign language software.  Maybe all the real innovation is with Rosetta Stone they've made over 78 million dollars according to the Instant Immersion box).  I'll use what I bought for what I can get out of it, not worth the hassle of returning it, but hope someday a more complete language program comes out that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

2130,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,1600775411,"If you want a good introduction to the Spanish language, I think this program would be helpful to you. It would also be a good companion product if you were taking a Spanish class or using a more comprehensive Spanish course product. Since I don't speak Spanish, I think I'm a good test subject. Here's what I liked and didn't like about this course:

I received the product as a Vine Voices item to review, but if I were to buy it, the price is reasonable for the amount of material you receive. There are 9 disc included, with lessons, in levels 1, 2 and 3, an Oscar Lake game, one disc that includes phrases in everyday language, and to perfect your pronunciation. There's also a disc that you can transfer to an MP3 player and carry with you. I didn't like that it's necessary to insert the discs in your computer in order to use the program, other than the one MP3 disc that I just mentioned. So if you're traveling, it's extra materials to carry around. It would have been nice to be able to just load them on a laptop. With a netbook, most which come without CD drives, this would have been even more of a problem.

There were a lot of lessons with phrases and some with sentences, but it was difficult without much knowledge of the language to figure out what some of the individual words meant. Many times I was guessing. It was nice to have all the photos and video of people talking, or at least of their mouths moving. I liked that they used both male and female voices and that they repeated phrases and sentences twice in most cases. I've learned numbers and some phrases, but I would have a difficult time putting together a sentence on the basis of what I've learned with this course. Different verb tenses which are important to learning a language weren't covered in a meaningful way. The MP3/iPod audio disc was useful, as far as it went, carried some information on verb tenses, but just not enough that I had enough understanding beyond the phrases covered.

I'm not sure how this program compares to Rosetta Stone because it's been at least 12 years since I've tried Rosetta Stone and in a different language than this and I'm sure there have been many changes in the program over the years.

If you need a companion course to a class you're taking or to a more comprehensive course I think this would be an great way to supplement that. Or if you just want a nice introduction to Spanish, to see if it's a language that you'd enjoy learning this product would also be excellent and the price is very reasonable.

It is because ""Rosetta Stone"" is so much better than the ""Instant Spanish Immersion"" Program.

I am a Spanish and ESL teacher. I have used both programs. Rosetta Stone uses a cohersive lesson progression that immerses you in the language by flashing hundreds of pictures in your face. You will be fluent in any language after using Rosetta Stone.

However, this ""Instant Spanish Immersion"" program does not use immersion. It teaches you vocabulary after showing you pictures that have barely anything to do with each other. You can quickly progress through the CDs without learning any grammar. How can someone be immersed into a language without complete sentences?

Well after you waist $40.00 on this product and try ROSETTA STONE you'll find out what I am talking about.

Level 1 in Rosetta Stone will teach you more about the Spanish language than a few CD's in this cheep program. Why do I need 3 CD's to teach me the numbers 1 through 20? That's rediculous! Not even my four year old is interested in the program.

We are going to France and I wanted to learn French before the trip.  I bought this produce as well as a new copy of Pimsleur French Unlimited level 1.

Rosetta Stone:
1. Easy to install
2. Lots of different ""types"" of lessons (reading, writing, speaking, grammar,etc.)
3. The ability to see the words and memorize the visuals.
BUT also
4. I hate the little ""correct!"" sound that it uses.  You can't turn it off.  It's terribly annoying.
5. My pronunciation is not very good because I can see the word and keep trying to pronounce it like it is spelled.
6. When I speak into the microphone, the program hates my effort and keeps failing me
7. All worked well until I hit Lesson #4.  At that point, the pictures because vague and I wasn't quite sure what I was saying or why.  I started worrying about verbs and rather than understanding grammar, just started memorizing things without understanding.
8. Oh my, the ""correct!"" sound became an aversion stimulus by this time.

Pimsleur:
1. Easy to install
2. Two types of lessons (listening and reading)
3. Because I'm not a good Audio-learner, I had to redo the lessons, sometimes 5 or 6 times
BUT also
4. My pronunciation got a LOT better because I was listening to the speakers and not looking at the words
5. I picked up enough of the grammar to understand what I was saying and recombine words and phrases rather than just mimicking them
6. This program doesn't attempt to ""reward"" you with that awful dinging sound

Bottom line?  I made it through Pimsleur French 1 (30 lessons) and am buying French 2.  I have found it much easier to use (DESPITE being a visual learner).  I quit at lesson #4 in Rosetta Stone.  I do not want to go back to Rosetta Stone unless they can:

1. Speed up the testing process.  (A more rapid click and on to the next question)
2. Eliminate the sound they use to indicate a correct response.

There is a lot of reinforcement through images and repetition.  I do find occasional problems with editing where the written statement is not the same as the spoken one, plus some typos.  There are also a few grammatical points that I have issues with, but they do have to do with the evolution of the language (I say 'adnde' in Spanish, but I don't say 'whence,' so I guess that I shouldn't complain.)  The main problem with this program is that it's boring.  Some friends have asked about whether or not they should use it with their kids, and I've had to warn them that most children won't be able to handle more than 15 minutes a day.  My daughter started out very excited, doing 45 minutes on the first day, then quickly got tired of it.

2164,A3FGJDBSMCSG7G,1615354336,"The Encyclopedia Britannica 2011 Ultimate Edition (formerly ""Student and Home Edition"") builds on the success of its completely revamped previous editions in 2006-10. The rate of innovation in the last five versions was impressive and welcome. It continues apace in this rendition with Britannica Biographies (Great Minds, Heroes and Villains, and Leaders), Classical Music (500 audio files arranged by composer), and a great Workspace for Project Management (a kind of friendly digital den). Six months of free access to the myriad riches of the Britannica Online complete the package (as well as monthly updates and discounts on a plethora of products).

The Britannica comes bundled with an atlas (close to 1800 maps linked to articles and 287 World Data Profiles of individual countries and territories); the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus, augmented by a Spanish-English translation dictionary; classic articles from previous editions; thirteen yearbooks (12,200 articles in total); Interactive Timelines with 4000+ indexed timeline entries; a Research Organizer; and a Knowledge Navigator (called The Brain or BrainStormer). All told, it offers a directory of more than 166,000 reviewed and vetted links to online content.

In its new form the Britannica is user-friendly, with an A to Z Quick Search feature. The Britannica's newest interface is even more intuitive and uncluttered than previously and is great fun to use. It offers morsels of knowledge, some of it date-specific, appetizingly presented through a ticker tape of visuals that leisurely scrolls across the bottom of the screen plus highly edifying interactive tours of articles and attendant media.

When you enter even the first few letters of a term in the search box, it offers various options and is persistent: no need to click on the toolbar's ""search"" button every time you want to find something in this vast storehouse of knowledge. Moreover, the user can save search results onto handy ""Virtual Notecards"". Whole articles can be copied onto the seemingly inexhaustible Workspace.

The new Britannica's display is tab-based, avoiding the erstwhile confusing proliferation of windows with every move. Most importantly, articles appear in full, not in sections. This major improvement facilitates the finding of relevant keywords in and the printing of entire texts. These are only a few of the numerous alterations and enhancements.

Perhaps the most refreshing change is the Britannica's Update Center. Dozens of monthly updates and new, timely articles are made available online (subject to free registration). A special button alerts the user when an entry in the base product has been updated.

Regrettably, the updates are not incorporated into the vast encyclopedia and its search interface: they are out there on a website. Moreover, the product does not alert its user to the existence of completely new articles, only to updated ones. It takes a manual scan of the monthly lists to reveal newly added content.

Speaking of updates, one must not forget to dwell on the Britannica's unequalled yearbooks. Each annual volume contains the year in events, scientific developments, and everything you wanted to know about the latest in any and every conceivable field of human endeavor, or Nature. About 12,200 articles culled from the last 13 editions buttress and update the Encyclopedia's anyhow impressive offerings.

The Britannica provides considerably more text than any other extant traditional encyclopedia, print or digital (a total of 62 million words). But it has noticeably enhanced its non-textual content over the years (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but words, words, and more words): it now boasts in excess of 30,000 images and illustrations (depending on the version) and 900 video and audio clips. This is not to mention the Britannica Classics: articles from Britannica's most famous contributors: from Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein to Harry Houdini and from Marie Curie to Orville Wright.

The Britannica fully supports serious research. It is a sober assemblage of first-rate essays, up to date bibliographies, and relevant multimedia. It constitutes a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy.

The Britannica's 84-107,000 articles (depending on the version) are long and thorough, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written by the best scholars in their respective fields. The company's Editorial Board of Advisors reads like the who's who of the global intellectual and scientific community.

The Britannica is an embarrassment of riches. Users often find the wealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form. This is why the Britannica incorporated the ""Personal Brain"" to cope with this predicament. But an informal poll I conducted online shows that few know how to deploy it effectively.

The Britannica also sports Student and Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product, replete with a Homework Helpdesk, ""how to"" documents, and interactive games, activities, and math and science tutorials. Still, the Britannica is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals. It provides unequalled coverage of its topics.

Ironically, this is precisely why the market positioning of the Britannica's Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is problematic: compared to the Wikipedia, the Britannica's brand is distinctly adult and scholarly. The vacuum left by the Encarta (lamented) discontinuance, though, should make it easier to market the Student and Elementary versions (which are an integral part of the Ultimate Edition and not sold separately).

Still, the 2011 editions of both the Student and Elementary encyclopedias improve on the past in terms of both coverage and facilities: the Homework Helpdesk is a collection of useful homework resources including a video subject browse; online learning games and activities; online subject spotlights; and how-to documents on topics such as writing a book review. There are also Learning Games and Activities: hundreds of fun and interactive games and activities to help students with subjects like Math, Science, and Social Studies. Both versions are updated monthly with new online-only articles.

The current edition is fully integrated with the Internet. Apart from articles about new topics and personalities in the news, it offers additional and timely content and revisions on a dedicated Web site. The digital product includes a staggering number of links (165,808!) to third party content and articles on the Web. The GeoAnalyzer, which compares national statistical data and generates charts and graphs, is now Web-based and greatly enhanced.

The Britannica would do well to offer a browser add-on search bar and to integrate with desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Currently it offers search results through Google but this requires the user to install add-ons or plug-ins and to go through a convoluted rite of passage. A seamless experience is in the cards. Users must and will be able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface.

Some minor gripes:

The atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Britannica are still surprisingly outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)?

Despite considerable improvement over the previous edition, the Britannica still consumes (not to say hogs) computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes it less suitable for installation on older PCs and on netbooks. If you own a machine with anything earlier than Pentium 4, less than 1 Gb RAM, and less than 10 Gb of really free space, the Britannica would be clunky at best.

But that's it. Don't think twice. Run to the closest retail outlet (or surf to the Britannica's Web site) and purchase the 2010 edition now. It offers excellent value for money (less than $40, with a rebate). For less than the price of an antivirus software and for a fraction of the cost of Windows 7, you will significantly enhance your access to the sum total of human knowledge and wisdom.

With the demise of Microsoft's Encarta (it has been discontinued) and the tribulations of the Wikipedia (its rules have been revamped to resemble a traditional encyclopedia, alienating its contributors in the process), the Encyclopedia Britannica 2010 (established in 1768) may have won the battle of reference.

2170,A33XJPI7NIPDHB,1615354336,"I own several different versions of Britannica software and although Wikipedia is more informative, I continue buying it to help with development costs. However, I do believe that certain aspects need to be improved to make this product better - or it will disappear despite of its long and proud history:

1. Their pricing policy is very inflexible. I bought v2010 for about $40 and while I was still waiting for the item to arrive, they released the new v2011 and made me a ""special discount"" offer (one intended for loyal customers) for the unbelievably low price of... $40. This kind of attitude does not make me feel ""valued"". If you know that you will be releasing your new version soon, either offer it for free to people who bought it recently, or sell it at a seriously discounted price.

2. Try looking for the same information in Britannica and in Wikipedia, and you will find out that the information in Britannica is - by comparison - quite limited, there aren't enough pictures, links, etc. Biography articles often do not include a picture of the person for example. Other articles include videos, but they are outdated and strange. I live in Varna, Bulgaria - a beautiful city on the Black Sea coast - and Britannica has always included video information on it which is probably 20 years old, taken from a strange location and containing factual and misleading information. One may argue that a single DVD disk cannot contain current video footage on all geographical locations but in the era of Google Earth what Britannica has to offer is sometimes beyond inefficient.

3. It seems that Britannica editors take quite some time to include information on a renowned person in it. Type in ""Tarantino"" and you get an article on... ""tarantella"" - ""a couple folk dance of Italy"". I wonder what should one achieve to be finally included in Britannica's ""Ultimate Reference Suite""? Google search has the answers that Britannica does not - and it is free.

4. A postal card for registering the software - by mail! - is included with your purchase. Britannica views itself as an 18th c. product that just happens to be on a DVD.

5. When you buy the DVD they cannot issue you an invoice. Here is what they wrote to me: ""We do not issue invoices as the order system that you have used is for consumer sales only. It is not for use by companies. There are a couple of problems here. The first is that the software that you have purchased is only sold with a single user license and so we do not allow the purchase of this by a company as a company is not an individual. The second problem is that we do not issue invoices for these orders. Only the receipt that you should have received already."" OK, I used their site to buy their software, they allowed me to enter my company's name in the corresponding field, and then, all of a sudden, I cannot get an invoice. The argument about the licensing issue is just laughable - I own about 40 software titles and all have been bought with invoices, it is only Britannica sales that feel special in this respect. I said, I am buying Britannica out of the goodness of my heart, and all I ask for in return is that the invoice is issued in my company's name so as to claim back $4 in taxes - but, no, they will not do it. That is very regrettable. It is also bad customer service.

6. Speaking of bad customer service, they never sign their emails to customers. I am signing my name, and the person (or people) I am communicating with are always faceless, have no names and remain hidden behind the neutral phrase ""Britannica Customer Service"". Have good business practices never reached Britannica?

7. This is a major drawback: Britannica does not download any updates to your HDD. They are made available through a special tab, but they are separate from what you have initially bought and Britannica likes to keep it that way. This is very inconvenient. The updates cannot be searched through the normal encyclopaedia search, so they are not truly accessible, unless you would like to search two times for every item.

I like running the software (although it takes a fairly long time to start), going through the different options, reading the articles. But I like all software and using dictionaries is what I do for living.

2179,A226YW0T8I0EZA,1617160199,"People have been praising these programs for a while now and I can understand why, but I think an exception has to be made for the Hebrew version, and I'll explain.

I purchased this back in January of this year to prepare for my up-coming trip to Israel in June.  I did have a very small vocabulary already of some Hebrew words and phrases before I bought this.  In all I would say I knew about 100 words, and short phrases such as asking someone how they are, and I did learn how to tell someone that I did not speak Hebrew and ask if they spoke English.  Very basic, but still maybe more than a lot of people getting this program.

So here is what I do not like about it.  I understand the importance of immersion, and there is not a speck of English in these lessons, and that is the problem, because no English also means no written English as well.  When pictures are put up you will hear the Hebrew word for it, and it will also be spelled using the Hebrew Alphabet, which of course means nothing to me, or to you if you don't know Hebrew, you obviously don't know the Alphabet.  It would be nice if they had a phonetic spelling of the words in English (like the Hebrew-English phrase books that I own).  I find this to be a big help, being able to read the word helps me to remember and associate the picture to the word, and also helps with pronouncing it.

To be honest, I have gotten more useful Hebrew out of the Pimsleur series of introductory Hebrew.  With that I can already speak complete sentences and have small conversations, and order in restaurants etc, and those I can listen to in the car, or at the gym and they cost much less.  As you can see between Rosetta, Pimsleur, and my phrase books, I have taken learning Hebrew pretty seriously, and have invested a good amount on it.  I won't say that I have not gotten anything out of Rosetta Stone, but it is not as magical as the adds that you may have seen make it out to be, and again, I think this may pertain to languages where the alphabet and the characters are so different from English.

The last criticism that I have is the included audio files that you get with it that you can download to iTunes.  I was really excited about that until I played them.  All they have is someone saying the Hebrew words from the lessons on them.  Not even the English word first, then the Hebrew word so that you know what it is.  It is like listening to a Hebrew movie or TV show with your eyes closed.  You have no idea what the word means if you don't already know it.  And if you have heard the word before but are not 100% sure on what it is, there is nothing to remind you, either you know it, or you don't, and that is confusing and frustrating.  I don't know how anyone could find that useful.  After about 15 minutes of listening and realizing this I didn't even bother listening to another, and went right back to my Pimsleur cd's.

Everyone learns differently, so what is not helpful for me, may be fine for you, but if you think this type of immersion learning is right for you, then go for it, because if you can learn that way, then I think you'd be rocking Hebrew in no time.",Softwares,2012-04-30,3,positive,people praising programs understand but think exception made hebrew version ill explain purchased back january year prepare upcoming trip israel june small vocabulary already hebrew words phrases bought would say knew words short phrases asking someone learn tell someone not speak hebrew ask spoke english basic but still maybe lot people getting program not understand importance immersion not speck english lessons problem no english also means no written english well pictures put hear hebrew word also spelled using hebrew alphabet course means nothing dont know hebrew obviously dont know alphabet would nice phonetic spelling words english hebrewenglish phrase books find big help able read word helps remember associate picture word also helps pronouncing honest gotten useful hebrew pimsleur series introductory hebrew already speak complete sentences small conversations order restaurants etc listen car gym cost much less see rosetta pimsleur phrase books taken learning hebrew pretty seriously invested good amount wont say not gotten anything rosetta stone but not magical adds may seen make think may pertain languages alphabet characters different english last criticism included audio files get download itunes really excited played someone saying hebrew words lessons not even english word first hebrew word know listening hebrew movie tv show eyes closed no idea word means dont already know heard word but not sure nothing remind either know dont confusing frustrating dont know anyone could find useful minutes listening realizing didnt even bother listening another went right back pimsleur cds everyone learns differently not helpful may fine but think type immersion learning right go learn way think youd rocking hebrew no time,0.055463980463980475,negative,14.0,positive,positive

2189,A2IJGDNXJM98JG,1617160067,"I attended a private school when I was younger and had 2 years of German language.  Later, I switched to a public school and the language receded into my subconscious since I had no one to communicate with.

Throughout the years, I made several attempts to re-learn the language and gave up in frustration.  I wanted to be able to think in German again, but the teaching methods created a translation process in my mind.  Finally, I decided to give Rosetta Stone a try and have completed levels 1 through 3.

This program helps build a solid foundation of the language because you are learning through association, not translation.  The lessons help you develop both spoken and written language.  As I progressed with the lessons, the content made sense and I found the Adaptive Recall sessions to be extremely helpful in retaining what I had learned.

I also noticed significant improvement in my comprehension and understanding of the language.  And, when exposed to German (outside of the software), I was naturally isolating unfamiliar words and determining the context to accurately interpret the meaning.  (Which I later verified by looking up the unfamiliar words.)

The only negative that I found with this program is with the voice recognition technology.  It works well for the most part, however it has not been perfected yet.  It works by comparing sound patterns.  So if the native speaker uses a different tone or speed for a particular phrase, you must replicate that exactly or the software won't recognize that it's correct.

Sometimes I pronounced a phrase precisely and had to endure several frustrating attempts for the software to acknowledge this.  Other times, I said the wrong phrase, but the software considered it correct because the tone and speed matched the native speaker.  (For example, the phrase was informal ""Was machst du gern"" but I said formal ""Was machen Sie gern"".)

2190,AKHKU6JCK94BI,1617160067,"Please don't take offense the title of this review. I just wanted to get your attention. I do not claim to be smarter than you, just more expert in foreign language teaching and learning. Full disclosure: I have taught French since 1967.

My first issue with this product is that the sequence of lessons, suitable for Romance Languages (I found Italian and Spanish very useful), works much less well for German. German is not  Portuguese or French. It, like Latin, has three genders. Nouns are declined. The agreement of articles and adjectives with nouns is, initially, quite daunting. As a result, Rosetta Stone German lesson presenting elementary concepts frequently require the learner to employ more advanced words and forms with which he/she is unfamiliar. That makes a correct response practically impossible. A recipe for frustration? Obviously. Why do it this way? Because that order of presentation works so great for French, of course!

I have already studied German (that was 48 years ago, but I still recall a ton, although I don't know where my keys are), so this program is fine for me. i know where the bodies are buried. This is by way of warning you that you had better have a firm grasp of English grammar, or be a language professor, or be exceptionally adept at language learning, or you will never use this application after an initial, disillusioning try.

Technically, I've found minor glitches during the first couple of hours of use: e.g., instead of the sequence prompt - time to answer - verification, one lesson has time to answer -prompt- verification. Minor, but initially confusing to me, who have written many language exercises. What would a novice would make of it?  Not very much, you can be sure.

The worst thing about Rosetta Stone products is that the company sees itself as an adversary of language learners, not an ally. They are offensively defensive over their intellectual property. To study Italian, I had to schlepp around a fragile DVD from home to work to weekend home. Spanish was fine. But installing German has been pure torture: Rosetta Stone is not allowing me to install German in Princeton for weekend use. And Rosetta has intentionally or accidentally created an infinite loop: you are told that you can use some of the features without registering the product. Just try! Prepare to be enraged.

Rosetta Stone throws around nickels like manhole covers. Prices are way high. Substandard language teaching techniques abound. Hire a first-rate teacher for each language, not just clueless native speakers. Were I running the show, I would work much harder on making my software perfect and my customers happy. We've all seen how Apple does it.

Rosetta Stone is technologically on the right track. Pedagogically, not so much. These are computer people, not language teachers. Otherwise, they would never  fail to approach each language as a unique challenge to learners; a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all approach respects neither the language nor the student.

I have no better suggestion than Rosetta Stone for learning materials for German. Beginners, buy only level one. If you can work with it, good for you! Buy the whole course. It's wonderful to learn a new language. I seriously doubt, however, that one student in ten will be able and willing to stick it out to the end of the first level.

2193,A2JWBF3XV9USE6,1931020752,"Both my daughter and I are born students, so we think the ""fun"" factor of this set is a 5-star. I recently purchased this set for my just-turned six year old daughter to support her continued learning of the language. We have found this set to be a high quality, excellent learning tools that are well-thought out and well-executed for this age range. The learning is basic yet provides appropriate and seamless supporting materials (flash cards, workbook, story book). In my experience, sticker charts are popular and encouraging to this age group and the vocabulary pace (colors, numbers, shapes, etc.) is the perfect entre into encouraging the young student without frustrating them. My daughter was easily able to navigage the software, despite having had minimal exposure to computer games up until this point. The graphics were engaging and smooth, even on our nine year old Dell Dimension PC.

This set alone is NOT going to create a fluent speaker, obviously; the lessons are too basic. However, there are many, many excellent skills and lessons to be learned by just sitting down and completing one 15-minute lesson per day/week, etc. Not only are there benefits to learning to speak and think in another language and appreciate another culture, but the act of simply sitting down and seeing that learning can be fun has many benefits as well. Doing this on a regular basis also sets the stage for homework that begins in the first grade.

That said, it's like anything... it IS what you make of it. Not all children may be patient enough to sit down and be engaged by a task that seems ""educational."" And not all adults are able or interested in using the supporting materials with their child. However, just on it's own merits, the CD-Rom does an excellent job of incorporating gameshow type fun and practice sessions that are just the right length (not too long) in order to keep the young set still interested, even wanting to come back for more.

2276,A1EL707B2404MT,1935341049,"I have been a user of SmartDraw since the VP edition and have watched it evolve up (including the 2012 edition)through the current CI edition.  This is one of the most amazing software products that I have ever used--hands down.  I have been a longtime user of both PowerPoint and Visio, but was looking for something more.  Visio is a great program, but cumbersome at times to use.  I was absolutely mesmerized when I came upon the SmartDraw website and watched the product video which makes a valid case about the powerful impact of visuals in presentations.  I felt like a kid in a candy store.  The possibilities are endless!

The program in itself is extremely easy to use, allowing one to focus more on the creativity aspect instead of the mechanics.  The layout has the ribbon familiarity of Microsoft programs while still maintaining its own originality.  These software designers are ahead of their time.  The automatic formatting and design templates are unparalleled with anything that I've ever used, and there is no more versatile program out there on the market.  The compatibility of Smart Draw with other familiar programs (e.g. Excel, Word, PDF, etc.) is a huge plus.  I use this program daily in my work, and it consistently puts my finished product above what others in our company can bring to the table.  It is my best-kept ""secret.""  One of the most ingenious features they ever came up with is the VPM (Visual Process Management).  It is what every manager has only dreamed of--a clever way to document every employee's job process so that information is readily available.  I use SmartDraw as much for personal use as I do for business; and my children even use it for school projects on a regular basis.

I have to pay a huge compliment here.  Most websites don't impress me, but this one does by leaps and bounds.  The customer support is outstanding.  This is one of the most resourceful sites that I have ever visited!  One actually develops a whole new vocabulary and insight on the perspective of business presentations from the wealth of information that is available.  Each concept is explained thoroughly both in the process as well as business strategy.  I can easily spend an hour every time I access their site, looking through the treasure-trove of examples, suggestions and ideas within the Product, Solutions, Training and Articles tabs.  Perhaps one of the best values of this program is what it gives to the user in a non-physical benefit.

2284,A1M1HDL68QJMYW,1935341049,"In my day-job I work as a business analyst in the IT department of a life insurance company ... and have done so for the last two decades.

Drawing all kinds of diagrams is part of my daily task. Now, we use Visio at work, and therefore I have been doing all of my drawings with Visio (for probably the last 8 - 10 years). Recently, however, I had to do some additional work at home in order to get a project's documentation prepared in time.

And because I have been using Visio for a long time (and therefore I know it very well) I decided to buy myself a copy [NOTE: I don't believe in pirated software]. However, when I saw the price for Visio, I was shocked ... and I realised I would never be able to afford it at that hugely inflated price. I don't have the funds like big corporations do, after all...

So then I started looking for alternatives ... and found several that were either free or had a free evaluation copy. I downloaded about 5 or 6 different ones, and installed them all.

Then I started using them ... and one by one I came to the conclusion ""this one is no alternative to Visio ... it barely does the minimum"" ... and some of them were so clunky. Each of them went quickly down the uninstall path --- except SmartDraw.

I found that I could get to work quickly with SmartDraw, even though the user interface is quite different to Visio (which I know very well due to many years' use). Using the evaluation version of SmartDraw I was able to finish my system documentation in spite of me being a novice SmartDraw user.

So, naturally, when I needed to have a visual processor to do some charting for my own business, I had no hesitation to purchase SmartDraw. I had already done all the analysis previously, and I knew that SmartDraw could do what I needed it to do.

What I didn't realise at the time of making the purchase, is that SmartDraw also has a massive library of tutorials and other training materials on their site, some of which I have already used and found helpful.

I am by no means a SmartDraw expert (yet), but from what I have seen so far I consider it to be even more powerful than Visio in certain areas.

There are some aspects of SmartDraw that are still a bit strange to me, but that is probably only  because I'm not an expert user yet. For instance, I drew a Timeline graph, and then wanted to move some of the elements. I found that I could move them, but that the connecting lines didn't stay connected, so I had to re-connect the lines. I also wanted to change the shape of an item, and although the help indicated that it is was possible to do it I couldn't do it (but I'm sure this was due to my lack of knowledge rather than a defect in SmartDraw.

The user interface is so intuitive and so well thought out you will take to it straight away. You won't find yourself scrolling through lots of menus to get things done, unlike other programs I have tried.

If your like me and like to learn things by video rather than reading large help files, smart draw offers lots of on demand videos to learn what sections of the program you wish to use. The program is so user friendly you may not even need to learn it, you just kind of take to it intuitively.

I have had the program for a few days now and already have tons of complex flow charts completed. There really isn't much of a learning curve but if you find you need help, smart draw has you covered.

I can get so much work done with this program because I am not constantly worrying about laying out boxes and stuff, the program formats everything nicely for you.

One of the most important things for me when choosing a visual diagramming software was the ability to be able to just pick it up and go without needing to learn the software, that's exactly what happened with smart draw. I opened up a document and just got going easy as 1 2 3.

Another great thing was all the different example files that come with smart draw, there is tons. If your not familiar with visual diagramming these examples can really help you get a grasp.

I have had this product only for a few days and already i couldn't imagine life without it. It has become an invaluable tool in my workflow increasing my productivity.

2311,A23XYMG7GATNZR,1935341049,"I started using Smartdraw shortly after the now defunct Micrografx discontinued Windows Draw! I am also a veteran chemical engineer well versed in the use of CAD packages. Smartdraw beautifully bridges the vast void that exists between expensive CAD packages typically used to produce abstract vector-based process drawings and the high-end raster graphics packages more typical of illustrations and graphics.

If you don't have the money to spend on CAD, nor the desire to learn what amounts to be very steep learning curve packages like Photoshop, but still need a way to communicate your data, ideas and concepts in a manner that will wow your audience (in spite of limited artistic skills), then give this software a shot.

The developers have continued to make subtle but substantial improvements with the package. Some highlights include the extensive symbol and graphics libraries that make assembly of rich illustrations trivial. The templates that come with this package are phenomenal as well. You can spend a couple hours just looking at all the examples and getting ideas from them. The smart graphs are a killer way to take the admittedly powerful tools in Excel up a notch.

Even though Smartdraw provides powerful and extensive exporting functionality, it is a simple one-click affair to get your work into Microsft office and it goes out of its way to make the integration (back and forth for those last minute edits) seemless.
For those who dare to do more, the granularity of the editing tools is all there, with and endless array of gradients, line, pattern, etc. that can be used to create custom, polished graphics. You can even set up your own templates along with common blocks and setting like I do and use them for common work.

Recently, they've jumped on the cloud wagon and provide an iOS app that makes work accessible and easier to manage. This has saved me already from an accidental file deletion.

As a process engineer, my work can be abstract and well, boring to many folks. Smartdraw changes that, making my drawings come to life and intuitive to casual observers given the nature of the graphics vs. simple CAD symbols. It's so simple to combine photos and vector graphics into one and kick off a pdf that anyone can view that you will be hearing ""how did you do that"" a lot.
The package does take some time getting used to. While the ribbon interface is done well, some settings and features can be a bit quirky. I still have trouble with snaps versus grid specs. And a couple pet peeves remain like if you rotate a symbol, it will cause connected lie arrows to rotate as well. There are work-abounds but it's still annoying.

After contacting SmartDraw, the representative told us that the only way to download it again would be upgrading to the latest edition, wich we found unacceptable; so we end up having to download a torrent a version of a software we already paid for. They also make  extremely complicated to authorize multiple installs. Instead of having an authorization system like itunes, they force you to login to their website and manually enable / disable every install.

With so many layers of security, one would think we were dealing with the best software on earth. I just wish Smartdraw would put as much effort on improving their product as they do in adding cumbersome  security features that only serve to annoy existing customers.

2325,A2DINW4DBA8APQ,1935341049,"This product has a unique approach to flow charting and when it works it is fast and fluid and beats Visio hands down. The mind mapping works great and is one of the best charts and really shows off what Smart Draw can do. However this is the exception not the norm. I bought it for use in creating diagrams for computer system and software engineering, creating a time line and flowchart for a book I'm working on, and for event flow charts in role-playing adventures.
The book I'm working on is a fantasy world and uses fantasy dates (1000 - 1200, etc). Unfortunately the lowest year you can ""customize"" is 1971. Quite frequently when you add another event to the timeline only the black handles appear instead of the full event box. You have to add another event to clear the artifact and see the actual event. If you open the sample Police report by Hour and try and change any of the times on any of events the entire chart will disappear. Or if you switch the Timeline format to Auto from Hourly, it'll create a very vertical time line. Switching back to hourly and you will be presented with a timeline and no events.
One of the most frustrating things about creating a flow chart is once you use auto charting either by using ctrl + arrow key or using the GUI you can't turn off snapping to that symbol. Any library symbols you drag near that symbol will attempt to auto snap. If you never use the auto charting then you can freely drop items onto the canvas and on top of other symbols. For the most part auto snapping is preferred as it is Smart Draw's main feature that differentiates it. However I was attempting to create a Post/Postback flowchart; which shows how the information flows from the client to the server and back again in web development. I wanted two small flowcharts in parallel to show this process. I ended up having to drop each flow chart symbol on the canvas and then after everything was in place take the line tool to draw a connection point in between each item. At this point, I was by passing the main reason I bought the software. This isn't very intuitive and is invasive to my workflow.
There are other visual bugs such as when you want to resize a symbol and keep the aspect ratio. You do this by holding down the shift key and dragging the handles. It works fine until a symbol is attached to another symbol by a line. When you attempt to resize in this scenario, the object will begin flashing yellow and very quickly jump from the size you want to the original size. This is very distracting and something you would expect to see in beta code but not release quality. It does resize correctly.
You can change the way symbols are sized by editing the symbol in the SmartPanel or Library. You can specify Use Fixed Size, Scale to Ruler Settings, or manually change but you can't do it for the entire library. There is no way to create a custom symbol list i.e. symbol palette.  Instead you have to switch in between the out of the box symbol libraries (which is a solid list).
Another annoying issue is that the undo does not work on the Ink functionality; it's a completely separate mechanism to the rest of the program.
If you do decide to buy, get the physical media. At $197 dollars for the software and $49.95 to be able to re-download it for a year it's too much. With Visual Studio Standard coming in at less than $200.00 it's the better value.
The product has so much potential I really hope Smart Draw fixes the issues and adds some enhancements to increase workflow with the next version.

2331,A1QBYO2SOAEKQR,1935341049,"I was confused by the reviews here, which seem to be all over the map.  In the end, I decided to take a chance and purchase SmartDraw 2012 Standard, which I purchased by phone from the manufacturer.  Their website offered only a downloadable version, and I wanted a ""hardcopy"" on CD.  The person I spoke with at SmartDraw was very helpful in answering questions, and said they can ship a packaged version for an additional $19.95, which I was fine with.  No sooner did I hang up, than I found an email with a link for downloading SmartDraw immediately, which I wasn't expecting, but really appreciated being able to use the software right away, without having to wait for the CD. There was also a second email with links to a series of tutorials - I appreciated this too.

I have started using SmartDraw to create some basic flowcharts and value stream mapping.  So far, the software is quite intuitive and fairly easy to use right off the bat.  In places where I got stuck, the help system has been informative and easy to use.  One thing I'm liking a lot is that while the program takes care of the automatic formatting of flow charts and diagrams, it seems you are not limited to just the symbols and elements within a particular template.  There are some basic drawing tools you can use to create ""custom"" elements on your chart.

The overall design of the program is pleasing.  It's simple, clean and functional, and easy to navigate.  I wish Microsoft would take a lesson, as the user interface is much simpler than, say, Word or Excel.  There are tons of different types of charts to choose from, many more than you will ever use (anatomical diagrams, anyone?).  For each type of chart there is a library of appropriate symbols and elements, as well as many ready made charts that can be used straight away if they fit your needs.  The automatic formatting, and the ability to customize the fonts, colors, effects, etc., make it quick and easy to produce charts to your liking.

These are my initial impressions after doing a few charts.  If I run into any significant problems I'll update this review.  By the way, I did not encounter any of the licensing issues or other complaints that some reviewers have.  It's possible that these issues pertained to earlier versions?  So far it's all been straight forward, with nice service and what seems like a good product that will meet my needs.  Maybe the company took note and improved its policies.  The company's website has a complete listing, with examples and tutorials, of all the different types of charts, so you should be able to get a pretty good idea if this product will meet your requirements.  For me, it was being able to see everything included in the product that made me decide to go ahead and purchase it.

UPDATE 3/20/2012.  I've had the opportunity to make some more charts, and I'm really liking the software.  Once I got accustomed to the method for adding, inserting, and positioning elements, I now find it very easy and fast to create charts on the fly.  In fact, it's so easy that I can really use the product as a thinking tool - that is, to work out my ideas in chart form as they develop.  The charts are also attractive; you can change fonts, font sizes, fill colors and shading as easily as you would do these things in a word processor.

2339,A3M5IV18BG093K,1935341049,"I was introduced to SmartDraw during my college years as part of a software class focused on object-oriented modeling.  The program has become so embedded into my professional career that I cannot think of being without it.  I have always maintained a license on my personal machine, but have gone so far as to purchase an additional license for a machine at my own expense to ensure that I'm also able to utilize the functionality at work.

If you're looking to diagram, chart, map, or make logical sense of ANYTHING, there's a template for it.  Comparing this program to Visio is doing it a disservice - SmartDraw goes beyond the simple diagramming available in Visio and allows you to actually use the software as part of a problem solving process.  SmartDraw has SO many templates available for you to use to kick off your thought process, and you can always modify them or just start from scratch as the mood suits you.

For those who would compare it to Visio, SmartDraw beats its Microsoft competitor hands down.  First of all, when you connect a line to something in SmartDraw, the program is intelligent enough to maintain that link even when you move things around.  Adding text, changing line formats, aligning objects, changing object shapes, and changing color schemes are 1-2 click functions (most of which are available from the right-click menu of a given object).  It's an intuitive program with limitless possibilities.

This program integrates seemlessly with MS Office applications.  As an example, if you have your PowerPoint presentation open and you have created an image or diagram in SmartDraw, there is a button at the top of the screen to ""send to PowerPoint"" which literally creates a new slide *in the file you are already working in* with your image in the center, waiting for you to add a title.

The customer service package that comes with SmartDraw is also exceptional.  Any time I've had a question or suggestion for a product enhancement, I receive a response within hours without detailed instructions on how to perform the functionality I was looking for, or a promise to forward the suggestion to the development team for a future release.  And since future releases and updates are always being pushed out with new templates and functionality, I have yet to be disappointed.

The ONE downside is sharing images to those who don't have the program.  However, as this same issue exists for Visio (which does a small fraction of the functionality and doesn't come with a built-in .pdf exporter), SmartDraw has and will remain my diagramming tool of choice.

Most of the problems posted seem to result from having used the trial or older versions of the software.  As I've been using this product for at least 5 years, I will agree that past versions had issues opening files and weren't as versatile.  However, these complaints should be posted on the page for SmartDraw 2009; SmartDraw VP resolved these issues by incorporating functionality to push out continuous updates as new functionality emerged and/or issues were identified and resolved.  As for the people posting negative reviews after only using the trial version, these appear to be people who want to get the software without paying for it and are upset that the company limited functionality in the trial to prevent that from happening.

2341,A2FQ5HDT4DWZNH,1935341049,"I downloaded the ""free"" VP trial version, based on glowing product descriptions, hoping to find an inexpensive practical solution for a particular kind of work.  What I found was that the program was priced at $300 for a single-seat license and will not do the kind of drawing it was promoted for. And its general design is quite poor, often awkward and unwieldy.  It probably will do some things reasonably well, but I think it is too limited and rigid for general use.

Worse, the entire marketing scheme is dishonest.  First off, they claim a five-star review rating on Amazon, ignoring the several one- and two-star ratings.  And it is grossly overpriced.  They offer a $100 discount if you purchase by a short deadline.  That ""deadline"" is regularly shoved out just a few days ahead to apparently stampede a purchase.  The $100 ""discount"" brings the price down to about the regular price on Amazon, so the whole ""discount"" offer is a sham.  The obviously shilled five-star reviews here are another example of dishonest self-promotion.

There is a basic principle in online purchasing (actually applicable to many aspects of life):  Never buy anything from anyone who lies to get your attention.

Notwithstanding all that, the program might be useful for some people for a limited kind of work.  For those narrow purposes even I might be induced to pay $30 or $40 for it.

2345,A23SE77CDU60SE,1935341049,"This is a very long review but I have endeavored to share what I have learned using SmartDraw since 2007 and the results of trying, but failing, to find a similar product.

8/8/2012 UPDATE I have updated to the 2012 version of Smart Draw and am very happy with the changes. I have recently worked with floor plans, elevations, gardens, graphs, timelines and gantt charts. I was frustrated and finally gave up trying to make a timeline that was by quarter for 18 months. I did a workaround and the result was quite nice. The floor plan changes are very powerful. You can get into a lot of creativity or trouble. For example, depending on where you place your curser you end up with angled walls or you move the whole wall. It took me a bit of time to learn the precise location but it is a very nice option.

2/9/2012 UPDATE I continue to use this program and appreciate the products it can produce. This last week I discovered a new thing it can do that I found extremely useful. There are times when you draw an object in another program, such as powerpoint, that blows apart when you try to move it. I discovered that you can take a copy of the graphic and plop it onto a blank page in Smart Draw and it copies as a picture. From there, save it as a sdr file, go back and so save as, and pick your image format--I usually use jpg. As with any sdr file, you can adjust the density and size of the image when you save it. This worked perfectly for me and when I imported the jpg into another program (in this case MS Word) it behaved perfectly. Of course, you can do the same thing with a photo editing program like PaintShop Pro or Photo Shop but this is quick and easy and if you already have the program open is it is quick and easy.

9/10/2011 UPDATE I am currently working on a project that requires a great deal of data analysis. I typically have the same data i Exel, SPSS and sometimes in txt format. I am working with data with a large number of cases or smaller ones with many data points. I have to analyze the data, convert it into to a variety of visual formats and then save it as a 8MB or larger file for publication. I can graph in multiple programs. I typically move the data to SmartDraw the graphical presentation because it has the most control over the presentation of the data and is easy to convert to large jpg files. However, there are three things that are truly bothersome. As I and others have noted the program crashes a lot. My office partners are used to me throwing my hands into the air and rolling my chair back while I wait for the program to restart. On the positive side, when it does restart my stuff is still there. My computer should have enough power to run a program like this so I believe the ""crash-o--matic"" aspect of it is in the program. Secondly, it is hard to change the font size on graphs. You should be able to select one of the sibling boxes and change the text in all. While I can make this happen sometimes it is not reliable which necessitates changing box by box. That said, I still think it is a good program. Doing the sort of thing I do is not trivial so having to wrestle with a program is not uncommon regardless of the program I use. My criteria is whether or not the program will ultimately produce what I want. I can answer affirmatively that Smart Draw does that for me.

7/24/2011 UPDATE I have been using VP for several months now and have changed my 5 to 4 stars. It is still a versatile program and allows you to do a lot of different things with only a little technical skill. However, I think the previous versions were easier to use when you wanted to do a range of different types of graphics. I have found that the libraries are harder to work in and it seems to me that there were things I used to use that are not there now. Of course, backwards memory is always risky but I think there were ;-). I would still buy this program, and I am glad that I have it. However, I strongly urge people to figure out what you want your program to do. As other reviewers have mentioned, Visio is better or that is better. I still believe that the ""better"" aspects are based on what you use the program for. I think Smart Draw is a very good choice if you use a lot of different types of graphics (e.g. brochures, charts, fliers, landscapes, etc). I do not think it is the best choice if you use one or a few types of graphics because there are limits and trade offs in usability to offer the range of modules.

3/30/2011 ORIGINAL REVIEW

THE BASIS OF MY REVIEW
Some reviewers cautioned that the highly ranked reviews were ""shill"" because people did not purchase the program through Amazon, and/or that they only had one review posted.  I cannot speak to those reviews but I can speak to my review. Upfront I will state that I did not purchase my copies from Amazon because I needed multiple seats and that was not available through Amazon.  I decided to review SmartDraw here since Amazon is a very important place to share product experiences. My review is based on frequent use of 2007, 2009 and recently with VP (2010).

I routinely purchase from, and review products on, Amazon. I always try to write the type of review that provides information to help people decide if a product is one they will like. I am far from the most frequent or popular reviewer but I have a good track record on ""helpfulness"" votes.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I affirm that I have not received any economic or other benefits from SmartDraw.  I have no friends or family members who work for SmartDraw. This review is entirely my opinion.

I LIKE SMARTDRAW VERY MUCH
I think SmartDraw is a very good program and a good investment. I also think there are issues to consider. After thinking carefully of its pluses and minuses for me, I decided to give it a 5 star rating because in my opinion the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. I have experienced a few limitations, some of which turn out to be lack of knowledge of the program, some that are idiosyncrasies of the program, some that are just unhelpful, and some that hopefully will fade with time. Having reviewed other programs, SmartDraw is the most versatile program of commercial or freeware that I have found. I am a researcher and being able to analyze data in various visual methods teaches me about my data and provides ways to show others what the data are saying. There is a problem with VP that I hope will fade away but have no assurance that it will. For reasons I do not understand, the SmartDraw company decided to create the new version (VP) so that it is not backwards compatible. This forces you to upgrade/purchase any seat that is using the images created or edited in VP. I have provided more detail below on all of my concerns. This has happened with other programs (e.g. transitioning from Word 3.0 to Word 1997) and fixes have followed. Hopefully there will be a fix and the problem will fade away.

Some reviewers have said that Visio is better. As one reviewer correctly pointed out there is far more information available for book and community tech support than for SmartDraw. I agree that for some functions Visio is a great choice. However, there are things that SmartDraw does do that Visio does not. I used Visio in the past and know that it is a very powerful program. It did not meet my needs for the type of scientific data analysis and graphing that I do. By comparison, SmartDraw is probably not a good choice for company IT management like Visio is. I think it is important to consider what you want to do with a program and then match those needs to your software.

THE PROGRAM

PROS
1. Multiple Graphic/Visual Analysis Module In One Program
SmartDraw is unique in that it combines multiple types of graphics in one program. SmartDraw is excellent for visual data analysis and creating graphics to display that data. I can be very good for planning and designing things like electrical systems, house plans, computer programs, and even landscaping. Perhaps the most important outcome of this multi-module design is that you can enter data once and then use it across multiple types data presentation. For example, you can put data in, display it in the graphing/charging functions and with one click display the exact data in the mind map module. I have been able to find programs that are alternatives to one or a few of the modules but none that work across so many modules. Additionally, when using multiple programs, linking them together is very time-consuming.

2. Data Analysis, Not Just Data Presentation
SmartDraw is not a just a graphics program. It is that, plus a data analytic tool. I use it in combination with a statistical program and it allows me to understand and display my data in ways I cannot with the statistical package alone.

3. Helps Convey Complex Thoughts to Others
SmartDraw allows me to construct graphic images to convey unusual or complex information to others.

4. Can Create Very Dense Files for Publication
You can create very large, dense graphics that are excellent for publication. We often write monographs and reports that are done in color and on good paper. We need incredibly large images (3-8 MB each)to have the quality necessary for these publications and for scientific posters. It is quite easy to do this with SmartDraw once you figure it out. I have never found any program that is similar for data analysis. You can draw lovely graphics for publications but you can also display information in analytic methods.

CONS
While I have listed a lot of cons here, they are most important for casual users. For serious users, there are generally ones that can be chalked up to idiosyncratic program quirks. Like most program, these quirk are things you learn to work around but are sometimes things that are downright infuriating. In my experience, some of the problems I have had were related to needing a deep knowledge of the program so you can figure out how to do it or find a decent work-around. A couple of the cons are serious. I also agree totally with reviewer that said SmartDraw is not a good program for serious, competent graphics designers. SmartDraw is a combination of ""get it done"" and sophisticated options. You can really do a lot with things program but it probably is not a substitute full-bore, full time, graphics designs. It can be a great part of a larger toolkit.

1. Advertised As ""Simple,"" But In Reality It Is Not A Program For Casual Users
SmartDraw is a multi-competence level program that can be hard to use for more complex graphics. It is not for casual users unless you want to use a pre-packaged item and just fill in their blanks.

2. Help Functions are Either Very Basic or Sometimes Hard To Find
The ""Smart Help"" feature is nice but the information provided is the very beginning level helpful to those who are ""filling in the blanks."" Not unlike some other programs, finding advanced help can be frustrating because what SmartDraw calls a function is not always intuitive. Sometimes the information is not in the help files.

3. Sometimes Overly Aggressively Automated
There are times that I cannot understand what is happening with with my graphic or how to enter and manage my data. The automated aspects of SmartDraw can be aggressive; it may reset parameters when you do not want it to do that. It can be tiresome to track these down so you can figure out what is amiss. This is improved in VP. The Gantt Chart module is an excellent example of the problem. Sometimes you set date parameters and SmartDraw ""fixes"" later dates by sending them to the default.

4.  Sometimes Limits the Complexity of the Data You Can Display
At times the program will not accept the parameters I want to use. For example, top level and sublevels can be difficult to display and sometimes you cannot force the program to analyze and display sublevel data.

5. Can Be Buggy
SmartDraw can be buggy. You can be doing something and poof, the program shuts down. If you have good ""save"" habits, the crash is a bother, but usually not fatal. Sometimes it can be a bigger issue. The file may lose its association with SmartDraw even though the extension is actually on the file. As a result of the uncoupling, your files look like text files so you cannot easily spot them. If you can find the file you have to open SmartDraw, navigate to the file, and then open it. You cannot click on the file itself. It also disappears from all locations of ""recent docs"" so it appears to be completely gone even if it is there. A little experience and you can find the files but it can be baffling at first.

6. No Backwards Compatibility (see more below).
SmartDraw VP is not backwards compatible with previous versions.

SMARTDRAW VP IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS
In a crisis moment, I ended up purchasing VP and *then* discovered that it was not backwards Not only had I created new images that could not be used on my other machines where I have 2009, I effectively destroyed my ability to access graphics that I had made minor changes on in VP. I do intend to upgrade all of my machines but for now cannot afford to do that so am stuck with a very difficult problem. I hope there is a fix soon.

MOVING LICENSE FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER
One commenter pointed out you can be forced into purchasing a new version if you change computers. This can be a thorny problem. When I had these difficulties, I had the presence of mind to enlisted the help of SmartDraw tech support. I own two seats (one for desktop and one for laptop). I decommissioned my old desktop and then could not install SmartDraw on my new desktop since I was effectively requesting three seats. After we identified the problem, Tech Support canceled my registration for the decommissioned desktop which allowed me to install it on my new machine. My problem was solved in just a few minutes.

TECH SUPPORT
Some reviewers say that they have had problems with tech support. My own experience is that they have been very helpful and meet my criteria for really good support. I recognize that you do have to have the ""premium"" version to get the tech support I have. I have purchased ""premium"" tech support on other programs and have not been as satisfied as I am with SmartDraw. Here is why I like them:

1. They answer the phone quickly and you get a real person.
2. It is possible to understand the accents of the tech support personnel. I understand that English and Spanish language support is available.
3. They listen patiently while you explain the issue and do not assume what it is or that you do not know what you are talking about.
4. They stick with you while you try to solve the problem.
5. They are downright honest in saying things like, ""Yes, it would be good if it did that but it does not.""
6. They will do phone support follow-up by email from a real person. Typically you can stay with the same tech support person through the resolution of a problem.

I originally purchased the product about a year ago to use on a specific project where I needed some unique visuals and project management tools. It worked well for that, particularly the Mind-map feature. When I had another project come up recently, I was presented with the offer to upgrade to VP; all I can say is wow!  The new version is beautiful, has more options, and more example templates.  Without even thinking about the help function, I jumped right in and was making complex figures in no time.  One really unique feature I really like is the export feature.  For example, say you are working in a Word document and need to add a mind map diagram.  You can fire up VP and create the figure. Using the export to Word option, the figure will be copied to the Word document where your cursor was placed when you left the document - a really handy feature.

2349,A2Q4PZFWZ05GWK,1935341049,"The VP to me stands for ""Very Poor""

This used to be the best drawing application out there -- at least when I first started to use it (back in 1997). Sadly, its best days are waayyy behind it. This application started out as shareware, reasonably priced, with free support and a 30 day trial period. No more. Now the cost is way up, the trial period is 7 days and real support is a ""Premium"" feature. Smartdraw's market focus has shifted to large corporations seeking a charting wizard for PowerPoint.

Smartdraw's list of lost features speaks to the decline and fall of this application:
-multiple floating libraries
-photo-editor plug-in
-user online space for sharing drawings
-hundreds of free graphics libraries
-support for postscript fonts
-etc. etc. -- you get the picture.

It is user-unfriendly, black-boxish and not for the creative.

I was ""suckered"" into upgrading -- you see, I just got a new computer and needed to re-install Smartdraw. But the Smartdraw website blocked the download of my previous version and offered me a deal to upgrade to VP.  It was no deal.

As an example; the software by SmartDraw allows you to create a room via dimensions, but when those dimensions are not round numbers the software will automatically round up or round down creating the inability to totally decide what your actual space is. Another noticeable fact is that several of the pre-designed shapes such as Cubicles are poorly created. If you break them down into the individual components (un-grouping) they become misaligned requiring several more steps to make them appear correct. Additionally, lining up objects is a difficult task, each object wants to snap to grid, but for whatever reason the grid is different for each object. I can't wait to get Visio, just ordered moments ago.

I would recommend staying away from this product.",Softwares,2011-02-14,2,negative,past days utilizing free trial version software typically drawings visio ways complicated but others makes much sense example software smartdraw allows create room via dimensions but dimensions not round numbers software automatically round round creating inability totally decide actual space another noticeable fact several predesigned shapes cubicles poorly created break individual components ungrouping become misaligned requiring several steps make appear correct additionally lining objects difficult task object wants snap grid but whatever reason grid different object cant wait get visio ordered moments ago would recommend staying away,-0.07745098039215687,negative,0.0,negative,positive

2352,A1L8GEOTWDNV19,1935341049,"I downloaded the demo and made a network diagram with relative ease. I liked the icons and the general features. There were a few bugs in terms of icons showing up, placing icons and copying icons. Many times nothing would show up or duplicates that were not selected would get copied. It was an annoyance but somewhat forgivable.

So after making my entire network diagram I opened it up again the next day only to find that the program was now refusing to open it up, saying that it was unable to open the file, it either doesn't exist or I am low on hard drive space. Obviously neither assertion was true. I couldn't find any information about this on their support site, but a google search turned up another potential fix, switching your default print driver. I did try this and it still didn't work, but apparently, this problem should have been mostly fixed in 2010. So now I have a worthless file that I can't even print to a pdf. Thanks smartdraw!

To make matters worse the reviews here are suspect since the majority of them only have one product in their portfolio. And their quoted ratings on their website are still blatantly false! They are trying to claim they have a 5 star rating on Amazon! It's always a bad sign when a company spends their time trying to gain unwarranted publicity for their product instead of trying to make the product better.

I also wanted to include the support poles in the design that appear every 19 feet throughout the space. There was no graphic for this in the included library.

I thought it was okay but I was looking for more conversational Spanish and I found Rosetta Stone to be lacking in the area of conversational Spanish, providing vocabulary words to review, and the content in level 1 was slightly too sophomoric for my opinion.  As a result I did research on the web read reviews and discovered that ""tell me more"" was the best rated on Amazon and other review websites.  I was very disappointed in the product, I found the software was not user friendly and I'm very computer literate. I was not interested in doing crossword puzzles and grammar exercises yet I could not complete the guided course work without it. when I went to free roam mode I found that there was not enough opportunity for the program to allow me to listen and repeat dialogue it was amazingly cumbersome just to make progress in anything compared to Rosetta stone. Additionally I'm not that interested in learning grammatical structure I want to hear people speaking, read the words and learn via  picture, association and repetition.  Also it did not have the dynamic learning mode this was also disappointing. I also discovered that the software was last produced in 2004, outdated. In  speech recognition mode it kept going and going and I get no feedback as to whether I was finished, it kept going no matter how many times I tried; it said my pronunciation was moderate while other speech recognition software showed my pronunciation to be good after practicing.

This is highly configurable language learning software in that you can choose to isolate your program to Comprehension, Expression, Vocabulary, and Grammar or choose Complete, which gives you a mixed bag. You can also choose to have the instructions in English or go totally immersive and get the instructions in Spanish. You also may choose European Spanish or Latin American Spanish though the primary focus is European Spanish.

There is a built in dictionary, translator, grammar explainer and links to numerous on line sites although the Club Auralog site is sporadic.

Tell Me More is Flash based so you must have Flash installed on you system. But they used it well and I really do have fun using the program.

My experience with customer support located in Arizona has been excellent which is a relief since Auralog is a French company.

One note, if you are a rank beginner - don't know one word of Spanish - scared of foreign language type, you might be better served if you start out with all the pictures in Rosetta Stone.

I wanted to learn on my own and did a lot of research to find the best Spanish learning tool available, tried several demos of different products, asked to various teachers...I even had Spanish speaking people try out the demos with me so I can have a feedback of what would be most effective!

At first, I was interested in audio CDs (Pimsleur,...) so I could learn in my car, or at home, fast and on the go, but I realized after trying that it will help me with my vocabulary maybe but I will never be able to get an intermediate level with audio CDs. Then, I looked for software, as it probably has the most potential for self-learning. I visited several websites with reviews like about.com, toptenreviews.com. I tried and was mailed different demos and really fell that TeLL me More was the best product for me, it has so many activities, and the speech recognition was really what I was looking as being able to speak was important. I could not see myself reach a high level with Rosetta Stone, as it was very basic and repetitive and seems to only consist of pictures over and over again. Other software seemed really inferior.
This new Premium version is great as it has all the levels in the same package so I did not need to worry about buying several packages, or even a headset and microphone as it includes one. It also has an audio CD, which was a nice bonus.

2379,A1E3OB6QMBKRYZ,3937514775,"Before I start, let me state I've been a computer techie for the last 20+ years.  When I first started Windows was only a dream and you had your choice of DOS and IBM compatible (both of which were really the same thing in the broadest definition).

Needless to say, things have changed slightly.  You now have Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux with DOS still hanging on for dear life (and  if you're a real techie, try UNIX).

I gave up on Windows when Vista came out and although I like OS X, Apple's stranglehold on computers running their OS has made that proposition a tad expensive.

Enter Linux, the poor man's Windows.  Yes, you can get a thousand different flavors but Ubuntu is probably one of the best (along with Suse) for each of use.

For example:

*  I recently had a computer which had Vista installed.  Something corrupted the OS and the manufacturer was nice enough to send me an install disk when their built in rescue partition failed.  After 4 hours of waiting and answering numerous inane questions I finally had my computer back once I popped in the installation disk.  The only problem was it no longer recognized the video and sound cards nor would it acknowledge the wireless card.  I downloaded the necessary drivers from the manufacturer only to have Vista reject them.  After a few more hours of tweaking and just about losing my religion I finally got things working.  That lasted about two weeks before the OS got funky again and started losing programs such as Quicken and the final straw was when it couldn't find my printer even though it was right there in the printers dialog box.

*  As luck would have it, I have ordered an Ubuntu disk from the manufacturer and had just received it.  From the time I popped it in until the time it was ready took roughly 20 minutes.  Yes, 20 minutes!  It not only recognized my NVIDIA video card and Broadcom wireless card it even downloaded the drivers to make sure both worked.  I then tempted fate and plugged in my Samsung USB laser printer.  Nothing happened, or so I thought.  Upon looking I realized it had found the printer and had already installed it!  Took all of about 5 seconds!

For those of you who are afraid to abandon Windows for Ubuntu you can go two ways -- the live CD or merely tell Ubuntu to partition the disk so you can still keep Windows.  Simple as that!

By the way, you have to option to install a bazillion free programs (actually closer to 5,000), many of which emulate comparable Windows programs.  You'd probably spend closer to $50,000 to get the similar Windows programs.

So, do the math.  You can pay $12 for this DVD (or get it free from the developer) or you can pay $100 to $300 for Windows Vista or $129 or so for Mac OS X (although you'll have to shell out another $1,000 or so for the Apple computer to go along with the latter OS).",Softwares,2009-01-18,5,positive,start let state ive computer techie last years first started windows dream choice dos ibm compatible really thing broadest definition needless say things changed slightly windows mac os x linux dos still hanging dear life youre real techie try unix gave windows vista came although os x apples stranglehold computers running os made proposition tad expensive enter linux poor mans windows yes get thousand different flavors but ubuntu probably one best along suse example recently computer vista installed something corrupted os manufacturer nice enough send install disk built rescue partition failed hours waiting answering numerous inane questions finally computer back popped installation disk problem no longer recognized video sound cards would acknowledge wireless card downloaded necessary drivers manufacturer vista reject hours tweaking losing religion finally got things working lasted two weeks os got funky started losing programs quicken final straw couldnt find printer even though right printers dialog luck would ordered ubuntu disk manufacturer received time popped time ready took roughly minutes yes minutes not recognized nvidia video card broadcom wireless card even downloaded drivers make sure worked tempted fate plugged samsung usb laser printer nothing happened thought upon looking realized found printer already installed took seconds afraid abandon windows ubuntu go two ways live cd merely tell ubuntu partition disk still keep windows simple way option install bazillion free programs actually closer many emulate comparable windows programs youd probably spend closer get similar windows programs math pay dvd get free developer pay windows vista mac os x although youll shell another apple computer go along latter os,0.05158317872603587,negative,-3.0,negative,positive

Now that 9.10 is out I think it may be the best OS I have used. And the best part is all Ubuntu OS are free online. There is no copy right violations or stealing in any way. There are numerous sites for support Linus/Ubuntu and if you can't find what you need just post a question and some geek will get back. I use the term ""Geek"" lovingly since these guys and gals really know their stuff, plus I am the proud father of a Geek, and are more than happy to help. Ubuntu itself has frequent updates and support. All the software that you may need or want is free and many of the products that other software vendors sell is free with Ubuntu. Few programmers ask for a donation but even those will run properly without shelling out money. I do believe in supporting those that work properly to encourage them to continue working on new projects.
Anything that a MAC or Windows OS can do, Ubuntu can do also. The difference is price. Ubuntu is free! Plus if you're not afraid to get a little grease on your hands you can get under the hood and see what makes Linus tick. The problem is tearing yourself away from the free games suchas solitaire, suduka, free photo editing programs, cd/dvd programs (please note...I use the plural because there are so many), and Open Office for word processing, spread sheets and other productivity programs.
Now the downside: If you can't borrow a copy from a friend, relative or library it may take a very long time to download. I say borrow because Ubuntu encourages everyone to give copies to friends. The biggest drawback in my opinion is that if are one that can not follow directions and read directions carefully then wait till your kids get home from school.
If you have an older machine this OS and any of the newer ones may not run correctly. My friend teaches grade school and has accumulated about two dozen donated computers, most using 98 or 98SE (Ver i386). All were DOA. After obtaining a copy of Edubuntu (6.06.1) she has resurrected these older machines and even has the USB ports working (which they did not work with MS older Operating Systems. Most of these older machines use the old floppy ""A"" drive and do not have CD readers/writers. For younger kids its great. You give them a computer that is inexpensive, you control what they have access to and you keep them offline so they aren't exposed to what kids should not be exposed to.

- Ubuntu is cleaner, leaner, and more stable than Windows.  Program crashes are less frequent.  When programs do crash, they usually don't affect the rest of the OS.  You won't have junk files and registry errors to worry about, and viruses and adware are simply a non-issue.

- The shear depth of options for both visual style and interface will simply blow your mind.  Right out of the box, Ubuntu has multitudes more customization than Windows has ever offered. Anything from the interface (system tray, task list, menus) can be moved and arranged anywhere.  Install Compiz Fusion and Emerald Theme Manager, and you'll expand your options even more.  You can literally trick out your whole operating system like a car in Need for Speed.

- Many of the popular visual effects and tools from Mac OS X actually originated in Linux.  You can have multiple desktops (Spaces), view all open windows (Expose), and even have a widget layer (Dashboard).  *Some of this requires Compiz Fusion.

- Installation of thousands of free software packages is a breeze using either of the 2 included ""package managers.""  You simply check off all the programs you want to install (and uncheck programs to uninstall), then hit OK and Ubuntu does everything for you.  An array of additional packages are available for download, and can usually be installed easily with a .deb installer.  Popular commercial software such as Skype, Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe AIR, Google Picasa, Google Earth, and other great programs are available for Linux too.

- The WINE program allows you to install and run many windows programs.

Having said all these great things, there are a few drawbacks.  There may come times where you do (unfortunately) need to run a specific Windows program that does not work in WINE.  You may want to leave windows installed alongside Ubuntu (dual-boot) so you have the option of falling back to it when absolutely necessary.

2397,A2JVLQNZHA34H2,3937514775,"I switched to Ubuntu Linux after wrestling for months with a failing Windows installation.  I was pretty sure my hardware had gone bad and loaded Linux only as a last gasp attempt to find out what was wrong.  To my surprise, I never had another failure.  Something had become corrupted in my Windows XP software.  I might have been able to recover XP by formatting the disk and redoing Windows from scratch, but the prospect was pretty demoralizing.

Now having said that, I don't want to mislead people into thinking that Linux will run without problems.  It might.  It might not.  How successful you are will depend to a considerable degree on the various devices you have - video card, sound card, WiFi network card, scanner, printer, etc.  Many devices will work out of the box.  Some will work if you go through the effort of finding and installing drivers for them.  Some may even work better than with Windows.  My Linux desktop and XP laptop will talk to each other fine, but my wife's Vista machine has trouble with both of the others.  Mileage varies.

If you switch to Linux from Windows, be prepared to learn some new things.  The OS is not harder to use.  In a great many ways, it presents the very same interface as Windows.  You'll see three little boxes in the upper right corner of each window that work the same as Windows.  You'll be able to use Alt-Tab to switch windows.  Control-C, X, and V will work the same in many applications.  The mouse works the same.  Firefox, Thunderbird, Open Office, and quite a few other applications will look and work the same as they do on Windows and, for most users, are just as good as the corresponding Microsoft software.

But you still must be prepared to learn some new things.  The more you do, the more you'll find that you can do with Linux, including some nice things that aren't in Windows.  If you feel awkward the first week, but are willing to learn a little, you'll be pretty comfortable by the second week and right at home after that.

As others have said, a big advantage of Linux is that it's free.  This isn't just a benefit for initial cost.  It also means you can upgrade your OS, your office suite, your picture viewers and editors, and most other stuff at no cost when the new versions come out.

It also means that you don't see the same quantity of nagware, crippleware, spyware, adware, spambots and viruses that you see on Windows.  And if you ever run into problems, you're free to switch to a newer or a different distribution without paying anyone a fee.

I loaded Ubuntu 8.04 and was happy with it.  When 8.10 came out I upgraded and was happier still.  As of this writing, I'm now on 9.04 and it all keeps getting better.  So far it all runs fine on my now five year old machine.

--- Later ---
I've upgraded to 9.10, then 10.4 64 bit on a new HP with AMD Athlon II with 4 CPUS.  It keeps improving.  I was concerned about whether the 64 bit OS would be safe, but it appears to be fine.  I won't be going back to Windows any time soon.

My main workstation is now on Xubuntu 12.4 and I've been experimenting with 12.10 in a virtual machine.  I switched from standard Ubuntu to Xubuntu when the ""Unity"" desktop environment came out.  Xubuntu with its Xfce desktop seemed to me simpler, less glitzy, more to my taste.  The ability to switch desktops like this seems to me to be an advantage over Windows.  The underlying Linux operating system and pretty much all of the applications are the same for Unity, Gnome, KDE, Xfce and other desktop environments, but you can choose what style of menus, icons, taskbars, window frames, etc., you want and usually customize them quite a bit too.

Windows still sets the standard for hardware manufacturers.  I was taken aback when my new Nexus 7 tablet used the Microsoft Media Transport protocol (MTP) for communication to a desktop computer and my Linux machine couldn't talk to it.  However I was able to find MTP drivers created by a smart open source programmer, install them, and get back in touch with my tablet.

But in spite of Microsoft's power over the manufacturers, things keep improving in the Linux world.  More and more hardware is supported.  When I bought an HP desktop with Windows 7 I was able shrink the Windows partition and install Ubuntu without a single hitch.  Everything just worked.  I kept about 10% of the disk for Win 7 on the theory that I might someday have to run some software that wouldn't run on Linux, but so far it hasn't happened.  The only times I boot up Win 7 are when I have to reboot Linux anyway and figure I might as well install the latest Microsoft patches while I'm doing it.

I still haven't paid one dime for software since 2008 and yet I prefer my Linux system over the Windows system I use at work, loaded with Windows, Office, Visual Studio, virus checkers, and other commercial programs.

Ubuntu is a Linux operating system.  Ubuntu Linux is not a version of Windows even though it runs on the same kind of computer.  If your computer was a radio, then Windows would be AM and Linux would be FM.  You can use either one, but only one can be the native operating system at a time.  You can listen to news on AM radio and you can listen to news on FM radio but you can't listen to AM stations on FM.  Generally, if your program runs only on Windows, it won't run on Linux.  (If you look too closely at this analogy, it will fall to pieces from all the exceptions.)  But that doesn't mean you can't get work done.

I like Ubuntu because I use it to to edit and layout a monthly newsletter with OpenOffice.org, an 'office' suite.  I use Thunderbird to handle email, including an address book, custom filters & folders, and multiple accounts.  I use Picasa to organize my photo collection.  I use GIMP to create graphics to use on web pages and other places and to edit/touch-up photos.  I play card games and an online tank fighting game.  I listen to mp3s.  I can read/write DVDs and CDs.  I can rip DVDs to .avi files that will play on my pda.  I use Slimserver to stream music to my home audio system, with custom playlists.  I can watch TV shows on the website Hulu.com.

I have entered data for a vast family tree using GRAMPS.  GRAMPS can import and export GEDCOMs and can create a multitude of customized reports about your family tree.

I use Pidgin to keep in touch with friends on AIM, and Firefox lets me use MySpace and Facebook, etc.  I also upload and watch videos on YouTube, read RSS feeds, and create photo books on Shutterfly using the Firefox browser.

I can open, read, and write .doc, .xls, and .ppt files from MS-Office using OpenOffice and share them with colleagues.  I can read and create pdf files, too.

All of the software I've mentioned above either comes free on the Ubuntu disk or you can download and add it for free using Synaptic, the software installer.

Probably the best thing about using Linux is the complete absence of nag-ware.  Your computer programs won't constantly nag you to ""set this application as the default for X type of file"" or to upgrade to the version that actually works.  Linux, and the applications on it, were created by people who use the programs.  They don't like intrusive ads, pop-ups, and nag-ware anymore than you do.  You can't buy software like this.

The system for adding and removing software, called Synaptic, is elegant and easy to use.

Ubuntu is not without flaws.  If you know what hardware you want to use, Google around and find out if it will work with Ubuntu-- sometimes there aren't drivers for certain kinds of hardware.  What that means is that your wifi card or your printer may not play nicely with Ubuntu.  Check first!

I have yet to find a Linux video editor for use by non-experts.  The video editing software I have found generally demands a higher level of familiarity with the technical specifications of digital video than I have come close to achieving.  I have to use a different operating system to make video DVDs of home movies & slides.  That's not to say it's impossible with Linux; it's just impossible for me with Linux.

There is a large and active Ubuntu web forum where I have been happy to find answers to my questions and very little of the geek arrogance that used to be so prevalent on the USENET linux newsgroups.

Ubuntu Linux is a great product, with free upgrades and updates, and an enthusiastic user community that will help you make the most of it.  It is as easy to learn as any new operating system-- if you made the jump from Windows 95 to Windows XP, or you taught yourself how to use XP, then you can use Ubuntu.  But remember, Ubuntu is not, and is not trying to be, a Windows operating system.

2448,A37T5J6QBH6IAS,3959828136,"My review about VideoDirector
Delivery: very fast and reliable as always. The software packaging is fine and the box looks nice and stable.
The publisher: Markt+Technik  concerning such software, this is probably one of the best publishers I know. Its really good value for money.
The software: The program includes also the Soundtrack Recorder. You can install it separately and use it without the video software. The recording of the Soundtrack Recorder can be started in the background  in my opinion really fantastic. It records voices and the music I played was recorded in good quality. (As a microphone, I use a headset from TurtleBeach and my speakers are from Logitech. I cant judge if the quality would be better or worse when using other hardware).
The Soundtrack Recorder offers these settings:
Modus (Stereo, Mono, Auto, Joint)
Bit-Rate (from 96 to 320)
Soundcard you use
Source of your recording
and much more

The VideoDirector itself offers endless possibilities and working with it is fun. Even my husband tried it. Installation was foolproof, the name is shown as Filmora Wondershare. After starting the software, you can choose between the simple mode and the advanced mode.
I prefer the advanced mode because of its diversity. You can even record directly in the program from your web cam, from your screen or directly record an audio track. According to my husband, this is the highlight! He is more interested in gaming but very enthusiastic about this software.
Otherwise, you can insert
videos
pictures
audio files
music
text
colours
and of course much more. But I don't want to write a novel here
You can upload your videos to online platforms directly out of the software, to Facebook, YouTube and Vimeo.
I received the product for a reduced price respectively free of charge for testing. This doesnt influence my opinion on this product by no means.
To put it into a nutshell:
Software doesnt crash
From a newbie in video editing to a professional in a few steps
Incredible many possibilities
Easy to understand
Includes a lot of sound files
Easy installation
Fascinating results

2458,A25H4MG7ASL8FW,3959828136,"Ok, this will be a somewhat lengthy review of this product, but I'm hoping it will help people decide whether to get it or not.  I've had this product for a few months now, almost 6 I believe.  And in that time, I've been satisfied with the editing software.  I decided mid last year to start a YouTube channel and wanted to get a video editing software to help me spruce up my vids.  I had been using Windows MovieMaker but it was so barebones and hard to work with when it came to large files that it wasn't up to snuff.  After searching and researching several different software packages, I decided to purchase this one.

Now, the major factor in me purchasing this software were 2 reasons and they were the following; First, this editing software is actually Filmora Wondershare.  It is known to be a very easy program for beginners to use in order to get acquainted with video editing software.  The second being that the software doesn't require a super high end PC to work.

I'm using a rather old but well taken cared of PC and this video editor works on it.  At the time I purchased the editing software, it functioned on both a 32bit or 64bit version of Windows.  Unfortunately, if you don't have a 64bit version of Windows, this will no longer work because of the recent update that was done to the editor.  Now, even though it does work with older PCs with 64bit versions of Windows, it doesn't mean that it will be a smooth experience.  Not saying that you will have constant crashes or anything, but you will notice a slower performance but that is because of the hardware.  It's not severe but it is noticeable and thus worth mentioning.

When you receive the product it will come in a DVD like package with both the CD and an insert containing the registration information.  Now, if you don't have a way to use the CD on your PC, you can head over to Filmora Wondershare's website and download the editing software with the link they provide and then use the insert to register the product.  I've read some of these reviews where it says that the product is a trial version, now I'm not sure what they got exactly, but from my experience, the initial installed editor is a trial version but when you actually use the registration information that is provided, it removes any watermarks or requests to register the product.  Be aware that to register the software, it requires the PC to be connected to the internet in order to access the site's activation page. If you can't connect to the internet, you have to contact Filmora directly.

Let's get to the actual software review, as I stated earlier, Filmora Wondershare is known to be a very easy to use video editor.  Many other video editors can be a bit complicated and overwhelm the user because it requires a bit of setup before actually using.  The beauty of Wondershare is that when you start the application, it prompts you to choose between various modes but the software still sets everything up for you.  So, if you choose the full mode, it sets everything up so that you can easily import your videos and drop them into the timeline to begin editing.  It has enough options for beginners to make their simple projects into professional looking ones.  You can splice, trim, insert transitions, overlay art that is provided by the software or your imported ones, add music, etc..  It has enough for a novice but more than enough for a beginner to tinker around with.  You can import a variety of different file formats, an exact list can be found on their website, I believe.  One of the great parts of the software is that you have enough options to render your file into several formats, from MP4, AVI, MOV, MP3, GIF and many more.  Again, there is enough here for the beginner to the intermediate video editing user.

One thing that really bugged me about the software is this, if you actually use the CD to install the software, it is installing, at least the CD I had, an earlier version of Filmora's video editing software.  That version has several transitions and effects in it that are worthwhile to use, but once you register the product it will force download the newest version.  Well, with this newer version, you actually lose access to some of these older effects.  I contacted Filmora regarding this issue and the reply was not helpful, basically these old effects were removed because supposedly the new editor had trouble using these legacy effects so they removed them and cannot provide you a link to download them again.  Definitely sucked to hear that.

I'm giving this product a 4 star rating simply because it is definitely recommended for someone that isn't familiar with video editing but want to start doing it for their projects or to start a YouTube channel.  For someone that has a ton of experience and has used other editors, that is another story.  Personally, if you like a ton of features this in no way will satisfy you as there simply isn't enough there.  For beginners it's plenty and a great way to learn.

Every now and then I see some interesting video that I would like to share with friends through Facebook. I needed a product that would allow me to edit my video files so I could send only the interesting parts and not the whole files. With Video Director I can edit my Drone Files, add Text and Music, and do other unique Effects then send the edited video to my friends.
